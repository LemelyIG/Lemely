"""Derive a per-mark-point ledger from a marked question and its mark scheme.

Pure: no session, no I/O. Returns plain dicts, which
:mod:`lemely.db.attempt_repo` turns into ``QuestionResultPoint`` rows — keeping
this module free of the model layer and its tests free of a database.

The rule that matters: one row per point **in the mark scheme**, not per id in
``matched_point_ids``. A ledger of only the matched points has nothing to say
about the marks a student did not get, which is the entire reason to have one
(spec 2026-09-17, "Write path").

Nothing here is invented. ``tariff``, ``point_text`` and ``mark_type`` are
copied from the scheme; ``rationale`` is copied from the marker's
``point_notes`` when present and left ``None`` otherwise (D2). An id the marker
claimed but the scheme does not define produces no row at all — never a row
with a null tariff pretending to be a mark point.
