"""``GeminiEvidenceJudge`` — one bounded call per challenged point, Gemini mocked.

The judge is lenient by rule, not by vibe: the prompt instructs "accept
unless the student's evidence is contradicted by their own recorded answer".
These tests pin what the call is given and what it returns; the rule itself
is text in the prompt and is asserted as text.
