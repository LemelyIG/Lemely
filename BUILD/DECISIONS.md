# Decisions log
(orchestrator records every non-trivial decision here: what, why, alternatives)

## Phase 1

### D1.4 — Auth backend split: GoTrue for email/password, self-signed HS256 for mock parent OTP
- **What:** A new `lemely/auth/` package owns identity. Email/password signup+login go
  through Supabase **GoTrue** (local stack): admin-create the user (service-role key,
  email pre-confirmed for dev, `role` in `user_metadata`) and password grant for login;
  every GoTrue user is mirrored 1:1 into `public.users` (id = `auth.users.id`, per D1.1)
  with role/email/phone. Parent **phone-OTP** runs behind an `SmsProvider` protocol whose
  `MockSmsProvider` logs the code; `AuthService` owns the OTP challenge lifecycle (generate
  → store → deliver → verify) and, on successful verify, **mints a Supabase-compatible
  access token self-signed with the shared HS256 `jwt_secret`** carrying the same claims
  GoTrue issues (`sub`, `aud="authenticated"`, `role="authenticated"`, `exp`,
  `app_metadata.role`, `phone`). Both token kinds therefore validate identically under the
  (next task) JWT middleware.
- **Why:** GoTrue's native phone OTP requires a real SMS provider (Twilio/etc.); the MISSION
  mandates a MOCK provider now with "one config switch to a real provider later." Owning the
  OTP challenge ourselves keeps the mock fully functional and testable offline, while the
  `SmsProvider` seam is the exact switch point. Self-signing the OTP session token with the
  same secret + claim shape GoTrue uses means the downstream validator needs no special case
  — email/password and OTP tokens are indistinguishable to RBAC. We already hold the local
  secret in `SupabaseSettings.jwt_secret`; this is a local-dev convenience, not a production
  key-management pattern (a real deploy switches parent OTP to GoTrue+real SMS and drops the
  self-signer).
- **OTP challenge store is in-memory (TTL, default 300s, max 5 attempts), NOT a DB table:**
  OTP challenges are ephemeral; adding a table would be a non-additive schema change outside
  the P1.3 schema and buys nothing (a single-process dev/test server). Recorded so a later
  multi-worker deploy knows to move it to Redis/DB. Deterministic in tests via injected
  clock + RNG.
- **Deps:** `httpx` added to the `web` extra (GoTrue REST client; already installed,
  matches the async-free sync-httpx call style); `pyjwt[crypto]` stays in the `db` extra and
  CI's test job now installs `db` too (needed to import `lemely.db`/`lemely.auth` at all).
- **Testing:** hermetic unit tests use a `FakeAuthBackend` + `MockSmsProvider` + injected
  clock/RNG and never touch the network; a live integration test hits the real local GoTrue
  + Postgres and **skips cleanly when either is unreachable** (mirrors `test_db_schema.py`),
  so CI stays green until a Supabase service block is added before the E2E acceptance task.
- **Alternatives:** GoTrue admin `generate_link` magic-link exchange for the OTP session
  (rejected: convoluted for phone, still needs an SMS-less verify hack, more moving parts);
  a real DB OTP table (rejected: non-additive, unnecessary for single-process dev);
  self-signing ALL tokens incl. email/password (rejected: throws away GoTrue's real
  password hashing, refresh-token rotation, and account lifecycle we get for free).

### D1.1 — Auth identity mapping: `public.users.id` == Supabase `auth.users.id`, no cross-schema FK
- **What:** Our application-owned `public.users` table uses a `UUID` primary key
  that is set to the Supabase GoTrue user id (`auth.users.id`) at signup time.
  We do NOT declare a SQL foreign key from `public.users.id` to `auth.users.id`.
  GoTrue owns the `auth` schema; our Alembic migrations own `public`. Role, active
  flag, and profile fields live on `public.users`.
- **Why:** Supabase manages the `auth` schema out-of-band (its own migrations); a
  cross-schema FK into a table Alembic doesn't control is fragile (reset/upgrade
  ordering, `supabase db reset` wipes auth) and is the officially discouraged
  pattern. Mirroring the id gives a stable 1:1 join without coupling migration
  ownership. Every other table FKs to `public.users.id` (which we own), so
  referential integrity across the app schema is fully enforced.
- **Alternatives:** Real FK to `auth.users` (rejected: brittle across resets, and
  Alembic autogenerate would try to manage a table it must not touch); a separate
  `profiles` table keyed by auth id (deferred — Phase-4 onboarding fields are
  additive columns; one `users` table is simpler now).

### D1.2 — Schema conventions (additive-only guarantee for Phases 2-5)
- **What:** (a) UUID primary keys everywhere via server default `gen_random_uuid()`;
  (b) all timestamps `TIMESTAMP(timezone=True)` with `created_at`/`updated_at`
  server-defaulted to `now()`; (c) role/enumerations as Postgres `ENUM` types
  (extended later with `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`, which is additive); (d) money as
  integer minor units + ISO currency code (never float); (e) confidence persisted
  as BOTH a band enum and a float score, mirroring `core.schemas`; method-mark
  breakdown persisted as JSONB; (f) sync SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Mapped`/`mapped_column`
  matching the sync engine in `lemely/db/session.py`.
- **Why:** Phases 2-5 must need only additive migrations (MISSION §4). UUIDs are
  merge/import-safe and let us mirror auth ids; timezone-aware timestamps avoid the
  classic naive-datetime trap; ENUM-add and column-add are additive whereas type
  changes are not; integer money avoids rounding drift in billing.

### D1.3 — Enum `server_default`s rendered with an explicit `::type` cast
- **What:** ENUM-typed columns that carry a server default (e.g. `subjects.board`,
  `seats.status`, `subscriptions.status`, `uploads.status`, `review_queue.status`)
  set it as `sa.text("'value'::enumname")` in BOTH the ORM model and the migration,
  rather than a bare `sa.literal("value")`.
- **Why:** With a bare string literal the model renders the default as `'value'`
  while Postgres stores it as `'value'::enumname`. `alembic check`/autogenerate then
  compares them by running `SELECT 'value'::enumname = 'value'::VARCHAR`, which errors
  (`no operator matches ... enum = varchar`) and, worse, produces a spurious drift
  diff on every future autogenerate — directly threatening the additive-only guarantee
  (D1.2). The explicit cast makes model and DB defaults render identically, so
  `alembic check` reports "No new upgrade operations detected". Verified live against
  the local Supabase Postgres.
- **Also fixed here:** the model modules imported `uuid`/`datetime`/`date` only under
  `TYPE_CHECKING`, but SQLAlchemy 2.0 resolves `Mapped[...]` annotations at runtime, so
  every model failed to configure (`MappedAnnotationError: Could not resolve ...
  Mapped[uuid.UUID]`). Those types are now imported at runtime; a scoped
  `per-file-ignores` entry (`lemely/db/models/** = TC001/TC002/TC003`) stops ruff from
  moving them back — mirroring the existing exemption for the pydantic web DTOs.

## Phase 0

### D0.1 — Single lockfile: keep `uv.lock`, delete `requirements.lock`
- **What:** Standardise on `uv.lock` (uv's native universal lockfile) as the one
  dependency lock. Deleted `requirements.lock`. `Makefile` `lock` target changed
  from `pip freeze --exclude-editable > requirements.lock` to `uv lock`.
- **Why:** The two lockfiles drifted (audit §1): `requirements.lock` was compiled
  via `uv pip compile ... --extra ui --extra dev` (missing the `web` extra) while
  the Makefile regenerated it via `pip freeze` — a different mechanism. `uv` is
  installed (0.11.29) and `uv.lock` already resolves all extras (ui+web+dev).
  CI installs from `pyproject.toml` (not a lockfile), so removing the pip-format
  lock costs nothing operationally while killing the drift.
- **Alternatives:** Keep only `requirements.lock` (rejected: pip-freeze output is
  environment-specific and lossy); keep both (rejected: guaranteed drift).

### D0.2 — GEMINI_API_KEY env-mapping trap fix (validation_alias + populate_by_name)
- **What:** `Settings.gemini_api_key` now uses
  `validation_alias=AliasChoices("LEMELY_GEMINI_API_KEY", "GEMINI_API_KEY", "GOOGLE_API_KEY")`
  and the model enables `populate_by_name=True`.
- **Why:** Audit blocker #11: an unprefixed `GEMINI_API_KEY` authenticated the
  CLI/Gradio (google-genai SDK env fallback) but left the web portal degraded/503
  because web AI gates read `settings.gemini_api_key`, which only
  `LEMELY_GEMINI_API_KEY` populated. Now one env var works everywhere.
  `populate_by_name=True` is required so `Settings.model_validate(model_dump())`
  round-trips (test fixtures rebuild Settings from a dump) don't reject the
  field-name key under `extra="forbid"`.
- **Alternatives:** Custom env source override (rejected: more code, less idiomatic);
  reading the SDK vars manually in each gate (rejected: scattered, error-prone).

### D0.3 — Test hermeticity against a developer's repo `.env`
- **What:** Added `tests/conftest.py` (session autouse) that disables `.env` file
  discovery in `Settings.model_config` for the test session; hardened
  `_IsolatedEnv` in `test_runtime_config.py` to also clear the unprefixed keys and
  chdir into a temp dir.
- **Why:** `Settings(env_file=".env")` reads a repo-root `.env` at every
  instantiation. A developer keeping a real `.env` (with a Gemini key) for local
  runs flipped 3 "without key" assertions (doctor, config defaults, web plan 503).
  CI has no `.env` and always passed; this makes the suite green everywhere so the
  unattended `pytest` gate is trustworthy. No `os.environ` mutation, no assertion
  weakened — only the stray file source is neutralised.

### D0.4 — CI now installs the `web` extra and adds a `web` job
- **What:** Test job installs `.[dev,ui,web]` (was `.[dev,ui]`); new `web` CI job
  runs `npm ci`, `typecheck`, `oxlint`, `build` for the SPA.
- **Why:** The FastAPI tests import `fastapi` (web extra) — CI omitting it was a
  latent failure once CI got past the (previously red) ruff-format step. Audit §9
  flagged the SPA has zero CI coverage.

### D0.5 — DET parser: wire the modular `lemely/io/det/`, delete the monolith `parsers_det.py`
- **What:** Adopt the staged modular package `lemely/io/det/` as the one
  `DeterministicMarkSchemeParser`; delete `lemely/io/parsers_det.py`; rewire the
  3 call sites (cli, gradio, teacher router) and rewrite the parser test suite to
  target the modular package. Both expose the same
  `DeterministicMarkSchemeParser.__call__(pdf_path) -> MarkScheme`; the modular one
  additionally takes `cfg: DetParserSettings | None`.
- **Why (evidence, not assumption):** Ran BOTH parsers head-to-head on the 4 real
  Physics mark-scheme PDFs in `Sources/`:
  - MCQ (`0625_m20_ms_12`) and alternative-practical (`0625_m21_ms_62`): identical,
    correct output — leaf-mark total == `maximum_mark` (40 == 40) for both parsers.
  - Theory (`0625_s19_ms_43`, `0625_s20_ms_31`): the **monolith silently returns
    wrong totals** (88 and 76 vs the stated 80) with no error — audit blocker #10,
    the exact "silent mis-parse" that poisons marking accuracy. The **modular parser
    runs its Stage-4 reconciler**, detects the mismatch, and raises `ParseError` so
    `ChainedMarkSchemeParser` routes the paper to Gemini instead of persisting
    garbage. It also honors `DetParserSettings` (the monolith ignores it entirely).
  - The modular package is already `mypy --strict` clean.
- **Consequence (recorded honestly):** With the modular parser, theory papers can
  no longer be "deterministically parsed" into a (wrong) scheme — they escalate to
  Gemini via the chain. On the raw no-Gemini path (`parse-mark-schemes` without
  `--use-gemini`) a theory paper now raises `ParseError` (fail-loud) instead of
  writing a silently-wrong JSON. For an accuracy-first product this is the correct
  trade: MCQ/practical stay fully deterministic; complex theory uses Gemini (the
  intended chain design) rather than emitting numbers that don't sum to the max.
- **Alternatives:** Keep the monolith and bolt reconciliation onto it (rejected:
  duplicates work the modular package already does cleanly, and the monolith still
  ignores `DetParserSettings`); keep both (rejected: MISSION requires picking one).

### D0.6 — Gemini cost cap: persistent file-backed USD ledger, $8 hard ceiling
- **What:** New `lemely/io/cost_ledger.py` (`CostLedger`) persists cumulative USD to
  `{output_dir}/gemini_spend.json` (atomic write, survives process restarts).
  Renamed `GeminiSettings.monthly_usd_ceiling` → `total_usd_ceiling` (default now
  **8.0**, active); added `usd_warning_thresholds=[4.0, 6.0]`. `GeminiClient` checks
  the ledger total before/after calls and publishes `BUDGET_WARNING`/`BUDGET_EXCEEDED`
  bus events on threshold crossings (each fires once, tracked in the ledger).
  `lemely/runtime/notify.py` (`post_ntfy`, stdlib urllib, no-op unless
  `LEMELY_NTFY_TOPIC` set) + `budget_notify.register_budget_ntfy()` (idempotent)
  deliver those events to ntfy, registered from the CLI and web entrypoints.
- **Why:** Audit blocker #5 — `monthly_usd_ceiling` reset every process, so there was
  no real cross-run cap. Verified fix with two separate OS processes sharing one
  ledger file: proc2 reads proc1's spend; $4/$6 warnings fire exactly once across
  the boundary. `lemely.runtime` stays free of domain imports (notify uses only
  stdlib) so the import-linter contract holds.
- **Test hermeticity:** `tests/conftest.py` now also neutralises ambient `lemely.toml`
  discovery (repo-root + ~/.config/lemely), needed because the rename would make a
  developer's local `monthly_usd_ceiling` key an `extra=forbid` error. Explicit
  `toml_path`/temp-cwd discovery still works.

### D0.7 — `lemely doctor` real Gemini reachability (acceptance criterion)
- **What:** Added `GeminiClient.check_reachable()` — a zero-token `models.list()`
  round-trip that raises `ExternalServiceError` on missing key / auth failure /
  network error. `doctor` (without `--no-network`) now calls it and reports the
  actual result, replacing the hardcoded `gemini_reachable=False` "not yet
  implemented" stub (audit §6/§10 #15). `--no-network` still skips it.
- **Why:** Phase 0 acceptance requires "`lemely doctor` reports the real Gemini
  reachability." `models.list()` validates credentials + connectivity without
  generation, so it costs nothing against the $8 ledger.
- **Tests:** live-ping reachable→all_passed; unreachable→exit 3 + gemini_reachable
  false (both mock `check_reachable`, no real network in the suite).
