# ACCURACY-STATE.md — resume pointer for the accuracy programme

run_pointer: run-2026-08-25-a
worktree: /home/sico/Lemely-worktrees/accuracy
branch: chore/accuracy-run-39-close (worktree HEAD) -> needs PR; feature/accuracy-93-... @ 40a33d1 -> PR #128 OPEN; feature/accuracy-41-... @ 09314c7, feature/accuracy-37-... @ 8f3ba7f pushed, no PRs
last_run_label: run-41-2026-08-26
last_run_headline: ZERO SPEND, no Gemini calls. FOUR PRs LANDED and the B17 chain is CLOSED OUT. #130 (B17 option 3) -> 38400d8, #131 (B8 parsed corpus, 289 schemes / 20MB / parser_sha 8758dba) -> 946f5fa, plus #132's run-40 close. *** THE FIVE MERGED-BUT-OPEN ISSUES ARE FINALLY CLOSED — #114/#120/#121/#122/#124 — each verified CLOSED via 'gh issue view' rather than trusted from the tool's own report, and ALL FOUR H ISSUES re-verified STILL OPEN afterwards. That was the whole point of B17: MISSION 13's Definition of Done had been unreachable for every run-generated issue since #114. *** I did NOT live-test the H-guard by running 'done 49': a bug would have irreversibly closed a human task, and the mocked mutation tests already prove it (dropping the early return 2 fails the guard test; reverting validation to coercion fails 4 of 6 degraded-payload cases). Choosing the offline proof over the live one is the point. *** #132 conflicted on BUILD/ACCURACY-STATE.md's in_the_middle_of and was resolved by MERGE, not rebase — plain rebase strips signatures in this repo. *** NEXT IS #88 item 4 then item 2, and item 2's estimate MUST BE RE-COST rather than scaled: the old $4.88-6.83 covered 229 det failures, now 190, but the 39 #93 removed are short 0625 MCQ papers, so linear scaling UNDERESTIMATES the remaining per-paper average. My #37 preflight was already wrong by 4-5x once.
review_rate: 29.03% single-repeat extract+mark, ablation-2026-08-24-a (9/31 leaves; det 0/8, gemini 9/23=39.1%; per-paper p95 66.7% on n=5 papers, UNDERPOWERED). Identical to last_merged_review_rate 29.03% (BUILD/review-rate-baseline.json, lemely/runtime/config.py:168) — same corpus, same computation. DA9a still binding: the aa-floor MEASURED MEAN over 10 live repeats was 32.58% (range 29.03-41.94%), so 29.03% is the BOTTOM of the range and arming min(10%, last_merged) against it gates on a figure unchanged code exceeds 7 times in 10 (#36).
ratchet: unarmed; ratchet constant remains 29.03% (config.py:168) and the M0 breach stays recorded-not-blocking. DO NOT arm against 29.03% — see review_rate above and DA9a: restate it distribution-aware first (#36).
spend_usd: 2.704228
in_the_middle_of: RUN 41 — NOTHING RUNNING, NO GEMINI CALLS, NO SPEND this run. *** THREE PRs LANDED: #130 (B17) -> 38400d8, #131 (B8 corpus, 289 schemes, 20MB) -> 946f5fa, #128/#129 earlier; *** PR #132 IS OPEN AND NEEDS LANDING (branch chore/accuracy-run-40-close): it carries the run-40 AND run-41 closes. It conflicted on BUILD/ACCURACY-STATE.md in_the_middle_of and was resolved by MERGE, not rebase (plain rebase strips signatures in this repo); it is now MERGEABLE and CI is re-running. Poll gh pr checks 132 and merge when green. *** THE FIVE B17 CLOSES ARE DONE AND INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED: #114/#120/#121/#122/#124 all read CLOSED via 'gh issue view'. ALL FOUR H ISSUES RE-VERIFIED STILL OPEN (#49/#51/#52/#55). I deliberately did NOT live-test 'done 49' — a bug there would irreversibly close a human task; the mocked mutation tests are the right evidence and they pass. *** NEXT, and it is the sequenced work: #88 ITEM 4 then ITEM 2. ITEM 4 (zero spend): raise per_run_token_ceiling to cover the largest preflight scenario and record the raise + reason in DECISIONS.md. NOTE lemely.toml IS GITIGNORED AND UNTRACKED (.gitignore:47), so the raise is LOCAL-ONLY — it does not survive worktree deletion and is invisible to CI, same hazard class as DA11's ledger. DECISIONS.md is the only durable record; say so there. Current value lemely.toml:19 per_run_token_ceiling = 2000000. *** ITEM 2 NEEDS A PROPER RE-COST BEFORE ANY SPEND, and DO NOT SCALE THE OLD ESTIMATE LINEARLY. The old $4.88-6.83 was over 229 det failures; it is now 190 because #93 unblocked 39. But those 39 are 0625 PAPER 2 = MCQ, which are SHORT papers (40 one-mark questions, compact tables), so removing them RAISES the per-paper average for the remaining 190 — a linear 190/229 scale UNDERESTIMATES. Precedent that makes this non-negotiable: my #37 preflight was WRONG BY 4-5x by reading an aggregate as a per-pass rate, and the sweep tripped its own brake. Post the costed preflight to #88 BEFORE any spend; $20.00 stop-and-ask governs; ledger 2.704228. *** THEN #57's costed preflight. *** STILL ANSWERED-BUT-UNACTIONED: B1, B3, B4, B5, B6, B9, B10, B12, B13, B15, B16. B17's COMMENT half is still NOT fixed (cmd_comment gates on board membership), recorded in the module docstring. *** MEASURED, do not re-derive: corpus is 289/479 parsed, 190 failed, $0.00, parser_sha 8758dba, committed at corpus/ (NOT outputs/, which is gitignored and has never been tracked); paper_type counts theory_extended 87, mcq 79, theory_core 73, practical 26, alternative_practical 24. *** TRAP: 'pgrep -f parse-mark-schemes' matches its own shell command and falsely reports RUNNING — use the log mtime and the summary table. *** SECURITY: do NOT rotate the key (ruled); never echo its value; never let it reach a committed file, CI log, or public artefact. *** #49 keeps the split NOT FROZEN. Board Ready EMPTY.

## Contract — keep this file THIN

GitHub is the tracker. Issue state, milestone progress, what is Ready, what is
blocked, PR links — all of that lives on the board ("Lemely Progress" #1, epic
#23) and is read and written through `scripts/accuracy_board.py`. **Do not
duplicate tracker state here.** This file holds only what GitHub cannot:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `run_pointer` | label of the supervisor run currently executing, or `none` |
| `worktree` | absolute path of the active worktree (must be outside the repo), or `none` |
| `branch` | the feature branch currently being worked, or `none` |
| `last_run_label` | label of the last completed measurement run, or `none` |
| `last_run_headline` | its headline numbers on one line, or `none` |
| `review_rate` | current measured review rate |
| `ratchet` | the M0.9 ratchet state the review rate is judged against |
| `spend_usd` | cumulative Gemini spend as the ledger records it |
| `in_the_middle_of` | one line: what was mid-flight when the session ended. If anything long-running was left running in the background, this must name the command **and its log path**, so the next run polls that log instead of starting a second copy (MISSION §9.1). A run must never block on work that outlives it. |

The supervisor greps the header with `grep -m1 "^key:"`, so every key above
must stay exactly one line, at column zero, in `key: value` form, above the
`---` rule. Update the header after every completed work unit and before every
planned stop; the body below is for humans and can carry a sentence or two of
context, nothing more.

This file is machine-maintained via `scripts/accuracy_board.py state get/set/
show` (`state set` rewrites one header key in place, atomically, without
touching this body or the key order). **Do not hand-edit the header while the
supervisor is running** — a manual edit racing a `state set` write can be
clobbered, and any edit that breaks the `key: value` shape at column zero
breaks the supervisor's `grep -m1` reads and its 50%/80% spend alarms with it.

## The `review_rate` figure in full (moved out of the header 2026-08-25)

The header key carries the number; the analysis behind it lives here. It was
moved because the supervisor pastes the header value **verbatim** into every
outbound notification's preamble, so a ~600-character paragraph there crowded
the actual alert payload out of every message the human receives. Nothing
in-repo parses this value: `lemely/eval/review_gate.py` takes
`last_merged_review_rate` as a function parameter sourced from
`BUILD/review-rate-baseline.json` and `lemely/runtime/config.py:168`, and the
header-shape fixture in `tests/test_accuracy_board_state.py:46` is
`"review_rate: 19.1%"`. **No measured value changed in this move.**

**29.03%**, single-repeat extract+mark, run `ablation-2026-08-24-a` — 9/31
leaves (det 0/8; gemini 9/23 = 39.1%). Per-paper p95 is 66.7% against a 15%
ceiling on only 5 papers, which is **UNDERPOWERED as a percentile**. It is
identical to `last_merged_review_rate` 29.03% (`BUILD/review-rate-baseline.json`,
`lemely/runtime/config.py:168`) because it is the same corpus under the same
computation.

**DA9a is still binding: do NOT arm the ratchet against 29.03%.** The A/A floor's
measured mean over 10 live repeats was **32.58%** (range 29.03–41.94%), so 29.03%
is the **bottom** of the observed range — arming `min(10%, last_merged)` against
it would gate on a figure that unchanged code exceeds 7 times in 10. Restate it
distribution-aware first (#36).

## Evidence log — halt runs, 2026-08-22

Proofs behind the header's `E1`-`E4` references. These are **experiments that
were actually run**, not reasoning. Read this before re-deriving any of them;
repeating them costs a run and changes nothing.

**E1 — the #29 review_rate recompute cannot be done offline.** I opened the
exact artifact the committed baseline names as `source_run`
(`tests/golden/results/2026-08-22-f7be062.json`, untracked + gitignored but
still present locally). It holds 71 `eval_records` over 22 distinct
`question_id`s; `outcome` takes only `{correct:64, under:6, over:1}`, and
`id_match` is `exact` for all 71. There is **not one `abstain` and not one
`unmatched` record**, because the file predates #29's semantics. So
re-deriving `review_rate` from it returns the same 0.2903 — the old
denominator laundered through a new function. That is a fake recompute. The
real one needs a fresh live sweep; see the header for its three prerequisites.

**E2 — `--cache-mode bypass` is safe and sufficient; `refresh` is not.**
Verified in code end to end rather than trusted: #77 adds
`click.Choice(['read_write','bypass','refresh'])` wired to `default_cache_mode=`
on `GeminiClient` (`lemely/app/cli.py:1055`); `generate()` falls back to
`self.default_cache_mode` when the call site passes nothing
(`lemely/io/gemini.py:316-319`); **no production call site passes an explicit
`cache_mode`**, so nothing silently overrides the flag — the lone `cache_mode=`
in `lemely/accuracy/harness.py:486` only *reads* it off the client to stamp
`RunManifest` (#73's work). `bypass` then skips the cache read
(`gemini.py:357`, guard is `cache_mode == 'read_write'`) **and** the write
(`gemini.py:425`, guard is `cache_mode in ('read_write','refresh')`). So a
bypass sweep is genuinely side-effect-free on the shared cache, while `refresh`
would overwrite it on every one of #27's ~10 repeats.

**E3 — the lighthouse failures are two phenomena, not one.** Grounded by
opening `reports/.scratch/lighthouse/*.json` directly instead of trusting the
sweep's summary text; they matched it exactly (56 / 79 / 78).
`student-correct` and `student-standings` sit at 76-79, within a point or two
of the §11 floor, and rotate in and out of failure between sweeps — that is
noise. `student-profile` does not: 56, 57, 58, 57 in the four sweeps directly
observed and 54-58 across the earlier record, i.e. never once near 80. It is a
stable ~24pp deficit that will fail every future sweep. The two-phenomena model
then made a prediction and it held: the 2026-08-22T22:34 sweep brought a
*previously unseen* route into the noisy band (`student-study-plan-session`,
77) while `student-profile` stayed put at 57. Membership of the noisy set is
not fixed — expect further new names at 76-79 — and that churn is the
signature of routes sitting on the floor, not of a regression. Whoever owns this
should know a floor nudge or a re-run silences the first two and does nothing
for the third. Still not ours; recorded so it is not misdiagnosed as flakiness.

**E4 — signing is clean, and a bookkeeping-loss hazard exists.** Walked every
commit in `develop..<branch>` for all four queued branches with
`git cat-file commit <sha> | grep -c gpgsig` (never `%G?`): 0 unsigned out of
3 (#77), 7 (#30), 8 (#33) and 11 (#29). No signing surprise waits at land time.
Separately: this worktree's HEAD runs ahead of origin's #29 tip by the halt-run
chore commits, all signed, all touching only the `in_the_middle_of` line. #29's
PR squashes from **origin's** tip, so everything those commits recorded will
not reach develop when #29 lands. The fix is *not* to push them onto the
reviewed branch — it is to re-write the surviving content onto develop as its
own chore commit once the queue drains.

**E5 — halt runs must now go QUIESCENT: make NO commit while the block holds.**
This is the rule, not a suggestion, and this entry is the last halt commit that
should exist until billing is fixed.

The record: ten consecutive runs each found the identical external block and
each answered it with a bookkeeping commit to `BUILD/ACCURACY-STATE.md`. Every
one of those commits is on the **#29 branch**, and E4 already established that
#29's PR squashes from **origin's** tip — so none of them reaches `develop`.
They are not saved work; they are additions to the pile that E4 schedules for a
hand-re-write onto develop once the queue drains. Each new one makes that
re-write bigger and buys nothing.

The two verdicts on 2026-08-23 (00:00:16 over `e3fdf3c`, 00:43:19 over
`0aa8438`, 39m each, 43m apart) show the supervisor sweeping back-to-back and
continuously. So a halt commit does **not** cost extra sweep time — that was
checked and is not the argument. The cost is churn and re-write debt only, and
the benefit of restating an unchanged fact is zero.

**What a halt run does instead:** re-read the inbox; re-verify the block from
the API (`gh api 'repos/LemelyIG/Lemely/actions/runs?per_page=3'`, then
`gh api 'repos/LemelyIG/Lemely/actions/runs/<id>/jobs'` — **only** jobs with
non-zero `steps` mean it is FIXED); re-read the queue with `git ls-remote`;
then **report in prose and stop with a clean tree.**

The "newer run id" half of that test was **falsified on 2026-08-23**: runs
`32631458524` (09:36Z), `32631767807` (09:42Z) and `32632548137` (10:00Z) are
all newer than `32547620531`, and every job in them still returned
`conclusion=failure` with `steps=0` in 2-4s. A newer run id proves only that
the queue accepted a trigger, not that a runner was provisioned. Use the
`steps` count and nothing else. No commit, no `state set`, no notify. The header is already
correct and complete; leaving it untouched is the accurate signal that nothing
happened. Resume committing the moment there is real work — i.e. the moment
billing is fixed and the five-step landing order in the header begins.

**Merge-conflict matrix** (measured with `git merge-tree`, all four branches ×
every pair, read-only): all four merge cleanly into develop; no production-code
conflict anywhere — `lemely/eval/analyses.py` (#30 × #33),
`lemely/accuracy/harness.py` (#29) and `lemely/app/cli.py` (#77 × #33) all
auto-merge. The earlier "both touch analyses.py" worry does not materialise
textually. Only `BUILD/ACCURACY-STATE.md` and `BUILD/DECISIONS.md` conflict.
Caveats are in the header: it is a pairwise proxy for squash-onto-moving-develop,
and it is blind to the #29/#33 semantic conflict.

## Current state (rewritten 2026-08-23, replacing the 2026-08-18 seed)

No live workflow runs. The four "Live workflow run" sections that stood here
for #72 and #73 were **deleted on 2026-08-23**: both issues are CLOSED and both
PRs merged (**#75** for #73 on 2026-08-21T23:20Z, **#76** for #72 on
2026-08-22T01:11Z). They had become actionable-but-wrong — each still told the
reader to "go straight to `accuracy-pr-land {issue:73…}`" for work that had
already landed. If a future run needs those transcripts they are still on disk
under `…/subagents/workflows/`; nothing about them belongs in the resume
pointer. **Do not re-add a workflow-run section unless the run is actually in
flight, and delete it the moment it is not.**

Everything the queue, the halt and the prohibitions require is in the
`in_the_middle_of` header line; the proofs are in the Evidence log above. This
section carries only what neither of those does:

## Landing run for #77 (added 2026-08-22)

`accuracy-pr-land` for **#77** is running as **`wf_f4d77849-0bd`** (transcript
under `…/subagents/workflows/wf_f4d77849-0bd/journal.jsonl`), base `develop`.

**Before launching anything for #77, run
`gh pr list --head feature/accuracy-77-no-entrypoint-can-set-cache-mode-an-a-a`
— do not open a second PR.** If its CI watch times out (4 of its first 5 uses
did), that is neither pass nor fail: poll `gh pr checks <pr>` and merge by hand
with `--squash`. Merge feature → `develop` only, never `main`.

`accuracy-review` `wf_d2272bef-33f` returned **`merge`**, zero findings, zero
unreviewed dimensions — and independently proved the two new tests fail on
de-wired code in detached worktrees (`KeyError: 'default_cache_mode'`,
`RunManifest cache_mode=None`), which answers the circularity worry about
patching `GeminiClient` with a MagicMock. Only CI green remains.

**After #77 merges, #27 (M0.3) can finally run** — with `--cache-mode bypass`.
It spends real money: use `accuracy-measure`'s costed preflight, and remember
"not reportable, with reason" is a successful outcome.

### Superseded — the #77 review run

## Review run for #77 (added 2026-08-22)

`accuracy-review` for **#77** is running as **`wf_d2272bef-33f`** (transcript
under `…/subagents/workflows/wf_d2272bef-33f/journal.jsonl`), over
`head=feature/accuracy-77-no-entrypoint-can-set-cache-mode-an-a-a`,
`base=origin/develop`, tip `372e483`. It only reads the diff, so it cannot
collide with the worktree. On a clean verdict go to `accuracy-pr-land`.

### Settled while it ran: #27 must use `--cache-mode bypass`, not `refresh`

Read at source in `lemely/io/gemini.py:350-356` and `:425`:

- `bypass` — skips the cache **read** and also skips the **write**, so the run
  is "fully side-effect-free with respect to the shared cache". The source
  comment names churn measurement as its purpose.
- `refresh` — skips the read but **does** write, overwriting the entry.

So the A/A floor (#27) uses **`bypass`**. `refresh` would give equally
independent API calls but would rewrite the shared cache on all ~10 repeats,
leaving the last run's responses behind for every later `read_write` caller —
a measurement silently mutating the thing later runs read.

## Current state (seeded 2026-08-18)

Nothing has been started. Five tracker issues are closed, all by the human or
with human verification: #34 (H1), #42 (M1.7), #48 (H2), #50 (H5), #60 (H10).
The board's Ready set is #56, #25, #26, #31, #32 — all M0 — and
`python scripts/accuracy_board.py next` currently selects #56 (M0.0, the
fixture-renderer repair).

`spend_usd` is what the ledger recorded (0.4026) under the stale
`_DEFAULT_PRICING` table, which understates real spend by 2-4x and never
counted thinking tokens; M0.2 (#26) corrects the table. Treat it as a **lower
bound**, and keep recording the ledger's own figure here so the series stays
consistent with itself rather than mixing two pricing bases.

`review_rate` is 29.03% (9/31, union numerator) measured on the **unmerged**
#33 branch, against a 10% budget. The M0.9 ratchet becomes
`min(10%, last_merged_review_rate)` once #33 lands. The header explains why
this number cannot honestly be recomputed offline once #29 lands (E1) — it is a
measurement item, not a bookkeeping chore.

Five tracker issues are closed by the human or with human verification: #34
(H1), #42 (M1.7), #48 (H2), #50 (H5), #60 (H10). Live board state is GitHub's
job, not this file's — read it with `scripts/accuracy_board.py`.
