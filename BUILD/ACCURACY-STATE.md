# ACCURACY-STATE.md — resume pointer for the accuracy programme

run_pointer: run-2026-08-21-a
worktree: /home/sico/Lemely-worktrees/accuracy
branch: feature/accuracy-29-honest-denominators-fix-d18-exclusion
last_run_label: none
last_run_headline: none
review_rate: 29.03% (9/31 leaves, union numerator, measured 2026-08-22 on the PRE-#29 denominator — see the caveat in in_the_middle_of)
ratchet: unarmed; starting value 29.03% recorded as a non-blocking M0 breach
spend_usd: 0.4668
in_the_middle_of: THE M0 QUEUE HAS DRAINED. All four branches landed 2026-08-23 under the human's CI waiver (commit 1289d8b added allow_merge_without_ci to accuracy-pr-land): #77 PR #78, #30 PR #79, #33 PR #80, #29 PR #81. THE BILLING BLOCK WAS NEVER FIXED — it was routed around. Every one of those merges rests on LOCAL gates plus the supervisor's out-of-session sweep; NOT ONE CI STEP HAS EVER EXECUTED against any of them (all runs conclude in 1-3s with steps=0, no runner provisioned). DROP THE WAIVER the moment a run provisions a runner, and treat the first real CI run on develop as genuinely new information. TWO DEBTS THIS QUEUE CREATED, both real work, neither optional: (1) THE 29.03% review_rate ABOVE IS NOW STALE IN PRINCIPLE. #29 changed which records enter the denominators (abstain/unmatched now count), and the number in this header, in BUILD/review-rate-baseline.json and in lemely/runtime/config.py review_rate_last_merged=0.2903 was measured BEFORE that change. The review-rate gate still PASSES because it compares against a COMMITTED CONSTANT rather than recomputing — which is exactly #33's own open follow-up (scripts/check_review_rate_gate.py has ZERO test coverage and cannot detect a review-rate regression from a code change; MUST be resolved before the ratchet is armed at M1). Recomputing is a MEASUREMENT item belonging AFTER #27: it needs human SPEND authorisation and #27's A/A churn floor first. Re-deriving offline from the saved golden run returns the SAME 0.2903 out of the OLD denominator — a fake recompute, the narrowed-denominator failure mode itself (Evidence log E1). DO NOT DO IT. (2) THE HUMAN'S TWO TOOLING COMMITS ARE STILL NOT ON DEVELOP: c08460f (diff-scoped gates + persisted gate logs, scripts/check.sh) and 1289d8b (the CI waiver in .claude/workflows/accuracy-pr-land.js) exist ONLY as local commits on the feature/accuracy-29 branch ref (local tip e4953f8), and #29's PR squashed from ORIGIN's tip, so they reached develop by NO route. CONSEQUENCE, verified this run: every checkout other than that branch has the PRE-WAIVER pr-land, which is why these four lands had to invoke it through a persisted script snapshot instead of by name. They deserve their OWN branch and PR, not a graft onto a reviewed one (Evidence log E4). A DECISION NUMBERING COLLISION was resolved at merge time: #29 and #30 both authored a 'DA7'; #30 landed first and keeps it, #29's became DA8, and CHANGELOG.md / DELIVERY.md / docs/ACCURACY-STRATEGIES.md were updated — the DA7 citation in lemely/eval/analyses.py points at #30's entry and is correct as-is. NEXT: #27 (M0.3 A/A churn floor) is now unblocked and MUST use '--cache-mode bypass', NEVER 'refresh' — refresh writes and would overwrite the shared cache on all ~10 repeats, while bypass skips the read AND the write (Evidence log E2). It SPENDS REAL MONEY: tell the human before spending. ENV: jq NOT installed (use gh --jq); pre-commit needs .venv/bin on PATH; verify signing with 'git cat-file commit <sha> | grep -c gpgsig', NEVER %G?.

## Contract — keep this file THIN

GitHub is the tracker. Issue state, milestone progress, what is Ready, what is
blocked, PR links — all of that lives on the board ("Lemely Progress" #1, epic
#23) and is read and written through `scripts/accuracy_board.py`. **Do not
duplicate tracker state here.** This file holds only what GitHub cannot:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `run_pointer` | label of the supervisor run currently executing, or `none` |
| `worktree` | absolute path of the active worktree (must be outside the repo), or `none` |
| `branch` | the feature branch currently being worked, or `none` |
| `last_run_label` | label of the last completed measurement run, or `none` |
| `last_run_headline` | its headline numbers on one line, or `none` |
| `review_rate` | current measured review rate |
| `ratchet` | the M0.9 ratchet state the review rate is judged against |
| `spend_usd` | cumulative Gemini spend as the ledger records it |
| `in_the_middle_of` | one line: what was mid-flight when the session ended. If anything long-running was left running in the background, this must name the command **and its log path**, so the next run polls that log instead of starting a second copy (MISSION §9.1). A run must never block on work that outlives it. |

The supervisor greps the header with `grep -m1 "^key:"`, so every key above
must stay exactly one line, at column zero, in `key: value` form, above the
`---` rule. Update the header after every completed work unit and before every
planned stop; the body below is for humans and can carry a sentence or two of
context, nothing more.

This file is machine-maintained via `scripts/accuracy_board.py state get/set/
show` (`state set` rewrites one header key in place, atomically, without
touching this body or the key order). **Do not hand-edit the header while the
supervisor is running** — a manual edit racing a `state set` write can be
clobbered, and any edit that breaks the `key: value` shape at column zero
breaks the supervisor's `grep -m1` reads and its 50%/80% spend alarms with it.

## Live workflow run — review of #73 (added 2026-08-22)

`accuracy-review` for **#73** is running as **`wf_2f56d604-60b`** (transcript
under `…/subagents/workflows/wf_2f56d604-60b/journal.jsonl`), over
`head=feature/accuracy-73-build-run-manifest-hardcodes-cache-mode`,
`base=origin/develop`, tip `ea83ffb`. Read that journal before launching
another review for #73. It only reads the diff — it does not implement — so it
will not collide with anything on the worktree.

On a clean verdict (`recommendation != block`, no `blocker`-severity finding),
go straight to `accuracy-pr-land {issue:73, branch:…, base:'develop'}`.

### Superseded — the #73 implementation runs

## Live workflow run (added 2026-08-22)

`accuracy-issue-execute` for **#73** was relaunched as run **`wf_ff14f7e7-9a0`**
(transcript under
`.claude/projects/-home-sico-Lemely-worktrees-accuracy/9685e88a-9272-47a1-b3d3-3a2cbeb96c5c/subagents/workflows/wf_ff14f7e7-9a0/journal.jsonl`).
Read that journal before launching anything for #73 — but see the header's
self-deadlock note first: if you are the implementer this run dispatched, that
entry describes **you**, not a rival, and you should proceed.

The earlier run `wf_dba29fea-8af` returned `implementation-blocked` with no
commits. Its **Scope** phase succeeded and its plan is worth recovering; its
**Implement** phase refused, so resuming it replays that refusal from cache.

## Review run for #72 (added 2026-08-22)

`accuracy-review` for **#72** is running as **`wf_95facc24-239`** (transcript
under `…/subagents/workflows/wf_95facc24-239/journal.jsonl`), over
`head=feature/accuracy-72-evalrecords-are-discarded-the-run-id`,
`base=origin/develop`, tip `91e9aa5`. It only reads the diff — it does not
implement — so it cannot collide with the worktree.

On a clean verdict (`recommendation != block`, no `blocker` finding), go to
`accuracy-pr-land {issue:72, branch:…, base:'develop'}`. Expect its CI watch to
time out (4 of 5 uses so far): a timeout is neither pass nor fail — poll
`gh pr checks <pr>` and merge by hand with `--squash`.

### Superseded — the #72 implementation run

## Implementation run for #72 (added 2026-08-22)

`accuracy-issue-execute` for **#72** is running as **`wf_f73ff647-3f0`**
(transcript under `…/subagents/workflows/wf_f73ff647-3f0/journal.jsonl`).
Read that journal and `git log --oneline origin/develop..HEAD` before
launching anything else for #72 — but see the header's self-deadlock note
first: **if you are the implementer this run dispatched, that entry describes
you, not a rival.**

It does **not** open the PR. When it returns, verify its claims yourself
(re-run the gates, confirm a clean tree, confirm signing with
`git cat-file commit <sha> | grep -c gpgsig`), then `accuracy-review` with
`head`/`base` passed explicitly, then `accuracy-pr-land`.

## Landing run for #77 (added 2026-08-22)

`accuracy-pr-land` for **#77** is running as **`wf_f4d77849-0bd`** (transcript
under `…/subagents/workflows/wf_f4d77849-0bd/journal.jsonl`), base `develop`.

**Before launching anything for #77, run
`gh pr list --head feature/accuracy-77-no-entrypoint-can-set-cache-mode-an-a-a`
— do not open a second PR.** If its CI watch times out (4 of its first 5 uses
did), that is neither pass nor fail: poll `gh pr checks <pr>` and merge by hand
with `--squash`. Merge feature → `develop` only, never `main`.

`accuracy-review` `wf_d2272bef-33f` returned **`merge`**, zero findings, zero
unreviewed dimensions — and independently proved the two new tests fail on
de-wired code in detached worktrees (`KeyError: 'default_cache_mode'`,
`RunManifest cache_mode=None`), which answers the circularity worry about
patching `GeminiClient` with a MagicMock. Only CI green remains.

**After #77 merges, #27 (M0.3) can finally run** — with `--cache-mode bypass`.
It spends real money: use `accuracy-measure`'s costed preflight, and remember
"not reportable, with reason" is a successful outcome.

### Superseded — the #77 review run

## Review run for #77 (added 2026-08-22)

`accuracy-review` for **#77** is running as **`wf_d2272bef-33f`** (transcript
under `…/subagents/workflows/wf_d2272bef-33f/journal.jsonl`), over
`head=feature/accuracy-77-no-entrypoint-can-set-cache-mode-an-a-a`,
`base=origin/develop`, tip `372e483`. It only reads the diff, so it cannot
collide with the worktree. On a clean verdict go to `accuracy-pr-land`.

### Settled while it ran: #27 must use `--cache-mode bypass`, not `refresh`

Read at source in `lemely/io/gemini.py:350-356` and `:425`:

- `bypass` — skips the cache **read** and also skips the **write**, so the run
  is "fully side-effect-free with respect to the shared cache". The source
  comment names churn measurement as its purpose.
- `refresh` — skips the read but **does** write, overwriting the entry.

So the A/A floor (#27) uses **`bypass`**. `refresh` would give equally
independent API calls but would rewrite the shared cache on all ~10 repeats,
leaving the last run's responses behind for every later `read_write` caller —
a measurement silently mutating the thing later runs read.

## Current state (seeded 2026-08-18)

Nothing has been started. Five tracker issues are closed, all by the human or
with human verification: #34 (H1), #42 (M1.7), #48 (H2), #50 (H5), #60 (H10).
The board's Ready set is #56, #25, #26, #31, #32 — all M0 — and
`python scripts/accuracy_board.py next` currently selects #56 (M0.0, the
fixture-renderer repair).

`spend_usd` is what the ledger recorded (0.4026) under the stale
`_DEFAULT_PRICING` table, which understates real spend by 2-4x and never
counted thinking tokens; M0.2 (#26) corrects the table. Treat the number as a
lower bound until then, and keep recording the ledger's figure here so the
series stays consistent with itself.

`review_rate` is the 19.1% baseline against the 10% budget. The M0.9 ratchet
(#33) is not built yet; once it lands, `ratchet` becomes the
`min(10%, last_merged_review_rate)` value CI enforces, seeded at 19.1% as a
recorded-but-non-blocking breach.
