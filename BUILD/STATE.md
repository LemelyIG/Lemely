## BUILD (MISSION.md) — COMPLETE

The MISSION.md build is finished. On first redesign session, fill this table from the
actual build outcome (read the prior STATE content / BUILD reports / merged PRs), then
treat it as frozen history.

| Phase | Status | Milestone PR |
|---|---|---|
| (fill from completed build) | DONE | |

Do not reopen build phases. Any build-era bug found during redesign: fix in place
if trivial, otherwise log under REDESIGN → Deferred Issues.

## REDESIGN (REDESIGN-MISSION.md) — ACTIVE

### Live status

```
MISSION:            BUILD/REDESIGN-MISSION.md
CURRENT PHASE:      2 — Brand & Design System (Phase 1 DONE)
CURRENT SURFACE:    none (audit is product-wide)
CURRENT BRANCH:     redesign/phase-0  (off develop; per-phase/surface branches per §11)
NEXT ACTION:        Phase 2. Brand strategy (brandkit), then logo generation via
                    Gemini (≤$3, flash for candidates, pro for the single final
                    render) as DECISION D2, then write the Study Notebook
                    DESIGN.md, implement tokens in index.css, and build the
                    component kit with its 8-state preview page. Phase 2 does
                    NOT depend on D1 item 6 — proceed regardless.
                    Fix DESIGN-AUDIT C1/C2 (the landing-page fabrications) in
                    this phase, not in Phase 4: they are a ten-line data edit
                    and they are the findings that could actually mislead
                    someone.

### Phase ledger

| Phase | Status | Completed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0. Setup & Verification | DONE | 2026-08-13 | All 9 skills loadable; nothing needed installing. Node 26.6.0, Python 3.13.5, Playwright 1.62.1 (web/), Gemini key in gitignored `.env`, spend $0.204/$8 (image budget for this mission ≤$3). impeccable hook already `enabled`; `context.mjs` clean apart from one stale-context finding, fixed. PRODUCT.md already existed from the build era and was corrected rather than regenerated (see notes). ntfy verified in **both** directions. |
| 1. Audit | DONE | 2026-08-13 | Three legs, all read-only, `web/` verified untouched after each. Merged into `BUILD/DESIGN-AUDIT.md`; leg reports in `BUILD/audit/`. 6 critical, 14 major, 3 minor. Root cause is one thing: every token is still the build-era Material-3 palette, so zero pages are Study Notebook yet. Worse than that and independently confirmed by me: 3 fabrications on the landing page, no error boundary anywhere, no skeleton component anywhere. **Coverage is partial and stated so — nothing was verified against a rendered viewport, and 34 of 48 routes were reached by grep only.** |

### Open DECISIONs

| ID | Question | Options | Default | Sent | Timeout | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1.1–5 | Five cost-free IA corrections (drop the student "Elsewhere" nav, add `/teacher/review` to the sidebar, in-app path to student notifications, 404 + error boundary, back/breadcrumb in teacher+parent) | proceed / object | **proceed as proposed** | 2026-08-13T15:05Z | 60 min | OPEN |
| D1.6 | Build real school-admin + platform-admin screens? None exist; both roles are routed into `/teacher` today. ~7 screens, new route subtree, un-bundles the `TEACHER_ROLES` guard `rbac.spec.ts` asserts against. | A build now / B defer, stay on `/teacher` / C scaffold routes+shells only | **none — deliberately not defaulted** | 2026-08-13T15:05Z | none | OPEN |

D1.6 carries no default on purpose: §10 says a question with no sane default must not be a
timeout question. It does not block Phase 2 or 3. Re-ask before Phase 4 reaches admin views;
if still unanswered then, that is the point to block rather than guess.

Resolved: none

### Steering log pointer

Full log: `BUILD/STEERING.md` (created in Phase 0).
Last processed inbound message: none from the human. The only entry on the inbound topic is
my own Phase-0 selftest (`IOd08AgAn9Hf`, ts 1786629363), and `LAST STEERING TS` is set past
it so it can never be replayed as a directive.

### Deferred issues (found during redesign, not blocking)

- **Phase 0 note — PRODUCT.md was corrected, not regenerated.** `/impeccable init` would have
  overwritten a build-era file that already carries five roles, the real product loop, the
  binding anti-references, and the evidence-on-hand list. Four edits were made instead:
  the deprecated `## Register` section became `## Modes` (impeccable v4 dropped register for
  the four visitor modes; nothing reads `## Register` any more), §4's anti-references and the
  protected notebook quality were added, and the line "layouts need not solve RTL yet" was
  replaced — it directly contradicted Phase 3.4's RTL-safety rule.
- **`DESIGN.md` at the repo root is build-era and predates the Study Notebook direction.**
  Phase 2 replaces it. Until then no surface work should read it as the token source.

## Update rules (for the agent)

1. Update `Live status` block on every work-unit boundary; `LAST UPDATED` always current.
2. Phase/surface ledgers: flip status only, append notes; never delete rows.
3. Gate status block is scratch space for the current surface; reset it when a surface
   merges (copy its outcome into the surface ledger first).
4. DECISIONs: add on send, move to Resolved with the answer on resolution or timeout
   (mark timeouts as "DEFAULTED").
5. `LAST STEERING TS` advances only after the message is logged AND acted on or queued.
6. Commit STATE.md with the work it describes, same commit.
