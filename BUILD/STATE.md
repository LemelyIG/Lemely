## Rules for maintaining this file
- Update BEFORE starting and AFTER finishing every task. Assume sudden death.
- Keep exactly one task `doing` at a time.
- When all Phase-6 acceptance criteria pass and DELIVERY.md is committed,
  set `status: COMPLETE` — the supervisor stops on this value.

## Phase 0 — Foundation repair
- [x] done — Read LEMELY_AUDIT.md fully; verify repo builds & tests pass locally
- [x] done — Fix ruff format on main-derived develop branch; create develop branch
- [x] done — Add web/ (typecheck, lint, build) + web extra to CI
- [x] done — Decide det parser: wire io/det/ OR keep monolith; delete the loser
       (D0.5: wired io/det/, deleted monolith. 371 passed, 84.13% cov. MCQ/practical
       parse correct; theory escalates via reconciliation ParseError — verified on 4 PDFs)
- [ ] todo — Persistent file-backed Gemini USD tracker, $8 hard cap, $4/$6 ntfy warnings
- [ ] todo — HistoryStore: surface corruption, add schema_version
- [x] done — Single lockfile mechanism; .env.example; fix GEMINI_API_KEY mapping trap
- [x] done — Remove dead: respx, live marker; leave lib/api.ts for Phase 2
- [ ] todo — Quality gates green; phase report + screenshots N/A; PR develop→main; ntfy

## Phase 1 — Database + Auth + Tenancy
(orchestrator expands this checklist from MISSION.md §4 when Phase 0 completes;
 same for later phases)

## Next action
Read BUILD/MISSION.md end to end, then LEMELY_AUDIT.md, then start Phase 0 task 1.

## Session handoff notes
- 2026-07-30: Started Phase 0. Created `develop` + `feature/phase-0-foundation-repair`
  branches off main (e091c81). Verified suite: 306 passed / 2 skipped / 82.39% cov
  ONLY when local dev `.env` + `lemely.toml` are absent. Those files carry a real
  GEMINI key that makes 3 "without-key" tests fail locally (test_cli_doctor,
  test_runtime_config defaults, test_web_student plan_post 503). CI is clean (no
  .env/toml), so this is a local-only artifact — DO NOT "fix" those tests.
- Reverted trivial EOF-newline diffs on 2 tracked Sources/*.json; gitignored BUILD/logs/.
