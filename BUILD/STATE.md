# BUILD STATE — single source of truth

status: RUNNING            # RUNNING | COMPLETE | HALTED
current_phase: 5            # Phase 4 complete, merged (321fdfc) and reported; Phase 5 not started
last_updated: 2026-08-09T15:40:00Z   # **Thirty-ninth session — PHASE 4 IS COMPLETE. P4.12 is DONE.** `reports/phase-4/REPORT.md` written and committed (`3bc5b8b`), merged to develop (`321fdfc`), both branches pushed, PR #3 retitled "Phases 0-4" with a full Phase-4 section appended and **left open, not merged**. This file is pruned per MISSION 8b: Phase 4's ~2030 lines of task detail collapsed to the summary below (2206 -> 229 lines) — the rationale lives in the report, `BUILD/DECISIONS.md` (D4.1-D4.25) and this file's git history.
#                                    **The report's numbers were measured this session, not carried forward from the chunk lines:** 2350 tests / 2344 passed / 6 skipped / 0 failed / **90.18% cov**; 122 axe route-states with **zero violations at any severity**; Lighthouse a11y floor 96; console errors 0; horizontal-scroll violations 0; 212 PNGs / 39 screen dirs; cross-phase compare **81 added / 0 removed / 78 changed / 53 unchanged**. Playwright 29/29. **No source file changed this session** — the tree is byte-identical to `bf74b89`, the tree the chunk-E gate run validated all 13 gates on, so that evidence genuinely covers the report's gate claim rather than being reused loosely.
#                                    **Three things found while assembling the report rather than assumed, each already acted on.** (1) `gemini_spend_usd` had **drifted to 0.1612** against a real ledger reading **0.18429** — same hand-copied-mirror failure mode as the `SeedContract` drift P4.11 chunk A fixed. Corrected in place with a note; **re-read `outputs/gemini_spend.json` before quoting a spend figure, never this field.** (2) The visual compare **can never be pixel-clean**: the seed's `run_tag` is random per run, so every screen rendering a class name changes on every re-baseline. **`0 removed` is the number that carries the gate**; a nonzero `changed` count is not by itself a regression signal. (3) The 78 changed captures were verified by **opening representative pairs**, not inferred from the diffstat — and `T-06/default--1440.png` turned out to be the best evidence in the phase: three at-risk students side by side, each labelled with a different rule, which is the **first image in the project's history where all three MISSION at-risk rules fire at once** (rule 2 had no target column until P4.3 and no seeded scenario until P4.11).
#                                    **Method note worth keeping:** `pytest --collect-only` still runs the coverage plugin unless given `--no-cov`, and it will clobber `.coverage` if you forget. The count above came from a clean serial `pytest` run captured before that.
#                                    **Next: Phase 5 (engagement layer).** Read the Phase-4 limitations below before planning — XP has no schema at all (only the `completed_at` seam), students still cannot see announcements, and `notification_preferences` is written and read by nothing. All three are P5's and none of them has a helper waiting.
gemini_spend_usd: 0.18429   # MEASURED from the real ledger `outputs/gemini_spend.json`
# (cumulative_usd 0.18428610, updated 2026-08-09T12:01:17Z), not carried forward. This field
# had drifted: it read **0.1612** at the start of the thirty-ninth session while the ledger —
# the Phase-0 persistent tracker that actually enforces the $8 cap — read 0.18429. The field
# is a hand-copied mirror of the ledger and nothing generates one from the other, so it is the
# field that was wrong, never the ledger. Phase 3 closed at $0.1586, so **Phase 4 spent
# $0.0257** across the whole phase (every automated test mocks Gemini; D4.3 made that
# structural). Re-read the ledger rather than this line before quoting a spend figure.

## Rules for maintaining this file
- Update BEFORE starting and AFTER finishing every task. Assume sudden death.
- Keep exactly one task `doing` at a time.
- When all Phase-6 acceptance criteria pass and DELIVERY.md is committed,
  set `status: COMPLETE` — the supervisor stops on this value.
- Prune a phase's detail to a single summary line once its `reports/phase-N/REPORT.md`
  is committed and merged to develop (MISSION §8b) — full rationale lives in
  `BUILD/DECISIONS.md` and the phase report, not here.

## Phase 0 — Foundation repair — DONE (2026-07-30)
All 8 tasks complete: CI green (ruff/web), `lemely/io/det/` wired + monolith deleted (D0.5),
persistent Gemini cost ledger ($8 cap, D0.6), HistoryStore corruption surfaced, single lockfile,
`lemely doctor` real reachability. 395 passed / 84.56% cov. Merged to develop.
Report: `reports/phase-0/REPORT.md`. PR #3 (rolling develop→main, NOT merged).

## Phase 1 — Database + Auth + Tenancy — DONE (2026-08-01)
Local Supabase stack, 22-table schema (additive-only, D1.2/D1.3), GoTrue auth + backend-issued
HS256 JWTs (D1.4/D1.5), RBAC on every route + both IDORs killed (D1.6), HistoryStore→Postgres
for the web surface (D1.8/D1.9 — CLI/Gradio kept on JSON store), seat model (D1.10), 3-device
session registry (D1.11). Adversarial review: no Critical/High bypass (D1.12). 548 passed /
85.44% cov. Merged to develop. Report: `reports/phase-1/REPORT.md`.

### Carried backlog from Phase 1 (non-blocking, do opportunistically)
- [ ] todo — (D1.9) Migrate CLI + Gradio history to the DB (or retire Gradio), then delete
      `lemely/io/history_store.py` + `tests/test_history_store.py`. Parity already proven.
- [x] done — (D1.6) Teacher per-tenant ownership (own-classes-only). Closed across P3.1
      (`ClassService` replaced the implicit "all students are one cohort" endpoints) and
      P3.3 (`/api/teacher/overview` stopped enumerating every student in the store; pinned
      by a two-teacher disjoint-class regression test). Row-level ownership is now real.

## Phase 2 — The core loop, real and end-to-end — DONE (2026-08-05)
Real SSE correction pipeline (P2.1), grade-boundary ingestion from cambridgeinternational.org
(P2.2, D2.1), accuracy harness + 10 golden fixtures across 0580/0606/0625 (P2.3), plagiarism/
AI-detection advisory flags (P2.4), Supabase Storage upload path (P2.5, D2.6), frontend
resurrected from dead code + auth/session foundation (P2.6), student + teacher surfaces wired
to real data (P2.7/P2.8), PWA foundation + camera capture (P2.9), Playwright E2E acceptance
verified against the live Supabase stack with an independent Postgres persistence check
(P2.10). 609 passed / 3 skipped (live-only) / 86.38% cov. Merged to develop (6254879), pushed.
PR #3 updated (title "Phases 0–2", body extended), NOT merged. ntfy sent.
Report: `reports/phase-2/REPORT.md`. Gemini cumulative spend $0.058/$8.00.

### Honest limitations carried forward from Phase 2 (must appear in DELIVERY.md, not silently resolved)
- **Accuracy gate NOT met (D2.5):** mark-level agreement 83.8% vs ≥95% target; flag_recall
  27.3% vs the 100%-disagreements-flagged target. Threshold tuning (D2.2/D2.3) and
  deterministic calculated-answer verification (D2.4) are both exhausted; the remaining gap
  is free-form algebraic method-verification — materially harder, out of scope so far.
- **PWA Lighthouse + camera-capture** not live-tested (no Chromium/camera in this sandbox,
  P2.9) — verified by inspection/manual trace only; see `reports/phase-2/pwa-limitations.md`.
  Needs a real-device/browser pass before claiming a hard pass.

## Phase 2.5 — Design system + frontend quality foundation — DONE (2026-08-05)
Token layer sourced from DESIGN.md (P2.5.1), C-1..C-13 component library + catalogue
(P2.5.2), Phase-2 screen retrofit onto tokens/components (P2.5.3), Impeccable audit+polish
(P2.5.4, D2.11), Playwright screenshot corpus (P2.5.5, D2.12), Puppeteer axe/Lighthouse
audit runner (P2.5.6), `scripts/check.sh` created from scratch — a Phase-0 mandate that had
never actually existed — plus a real CI-breaking `ruff`/`.claude` exclusion bug fixed along
the way (P2.5.7, D2.13), full QUALITY-BAR.md pass to zero serious/critical axe violations +
Lighthouse a11y 100 across all 4 in-scope routes (P2.5.8, D2.14). 609 passed / 85.54% cov
(zero backend files touched this phase; coverage delta from Phase 2 is environmental
live-test-skip variance, not a regression — see report §4). Merged to develop (fcc3e07),
pushed. PR #3 updated (title "Phases 0–2.5"), NOT merged. ntfy sent.
Report: `reports/phase-2.5/REPORT.md`. Gemini cumulative spend $0.058/$8.00 (unchanged —
pure frontend/tooling phase, zero LLM calls).
Decisions: D2.10–D2.14. Deferred/flagged component-library gaps for a future pass: see
report §8 (sub-44px touch target, non-heading empty/error tags, no mobile BottomNav, raw
`max-[1180px]:` literals outside the retrofitted screens, momentum-chart/TrendSparkline
duplication blocked on a DTO change).

## Phase 3 — Teacher + Parent surfaces — DONE (2026-08-07)
Real class model + teacher tenancy closing the last cross-tenant leak (P3.1, D3.1), the
at-risk flagging engine (P3.2, D3.3), teacher analytics T-04/T-05/T-06 (P3.3, D3.4), review
queue override-and-annotate + evidence-scoped acknowledgement (P3.4/P3.4b, D3.5), the quiz
builder end to end — bank, builder, assignment, student take/submit, auto-marking through the
*existing* engine, class results (P3.5, D3.6–D3.10, design fixed in `docs/quiz-model.md`),
parent portal backend + notification preferences (P3.6, D3.11), sixteen frontend screens
across three portals all on real data (P3.7 T-01..T-06, P3.8 T-07..T-10 + T-12 + the
announcements backend, P3.9 G-05 + P-01..P-04), and the acceptance/UI-gate pass that turned
`audit.mjs` from a 4-route single-journey script into a 24-route/34-state registry
(P3.10, D3.17/D3.18/D3.20). Plus the INBOX real-past-paper accuracy directive (D3.21) and the
MCQ integrity guard (D3.19). Blockers B1/B2/B3 all raised and resolved.
**1939 tests (1933 passed / 6 skipped / 0 failed) / 89.42% cov** (from develop's 609 /
85.54%); **all 13 gates green, 0 skipped**; 5 additive migrations, `alembic check` clean both
directions; 24 routes / 34 states audited with zero axe violations at any severity, zero
console errors, zero horizontal-scroll violations, Lighthouse a11y floor 96. Merged to develop
(49d9750), pushed. PR #3 updated (title "Phases 0–3"; its body had never actually carried a
Phase-2.5 section despite that phase's STATE line claiming so — added in the same edit), NOT
merged. Report: `reports/phase-3/REPORT.md`. Gemini cumulative spend **$0.1586 / $8.00**.

### Honest limitations carried forward from Phase 3 (must appear in DELIVERY.md, not silently resolved)
Full text in `reports/phase-3/REPORT.md` §7. The ones that change what a later phase may
assume:
- **The question bank is empty and corpus growth cannot change that (D3.7).** A mark scheme
  holds marking points; the question *stem* lives in the question paper and no stem extractor
  exists. This is a **P4 prerequisite**, not an assumption — do not re-run the measurement.
- ~~**At-risk rule 2 cannot fire until P4 supplies target grades (D3.3)**~~ — **CLOSED by P4.3**
  (D4.5). Targets are real and per-subject, the rule fires, and `below_target` is now in the T-06
  reason filter. The *not evaluable* state survives and got stricter, not weaker.
- **Teacher-route Lighthouse performance floors at 67** (`teacher-quiz-detail`). MISSION §11's
  ≥80 floor covers the student routes (met, floor 82) and never covered these.
- **Lighthouse runs on `default` states only**; axe runs on all 34 (deliberate, D3.17).
- **`web/e2e/` + `playwright.config.ts` are in no tsconfig `include`** — the most expensive
  gate has never been typechecked (D3.20).
- **Students cannot see announcements**; `notification_preferences` is written and read by
  nothing. Both are **P5's**, and P5 must not assume Phase 3 left it a helper.
- **Paper 22 was confidently wrong (D3.21):** all 40 marks at confidence 1.0, zero review
  flags, 3 marks of pure vision/transcription error. Propagating extraction confidence into
  per-question confidence on the deterministic MCQ path changes the marking contract and was
  deliberately not patched at phase end.
- **Phase 2's synthetic-golden-set accuracy gate is unchanged** (83.8% vs ≥95%). The
  real-paper measurement is on top of it, not a replacement.

### Task checklist

      (D3.1–D3.21), `BUILD/BLOCKERS.md` (B1–B3), or this file's git history.
- [x] done — **P3.11** Phase-3 report, merge to develop, push, update PR #3, ntfy.

## Phase 4 — Content generation + study plans — DONE (2026-08-09)
Question-stem extractor closing D3.7 (P4.1, D4.1/D4.2 — 72 papers → 273 banked 0625 stems),
syllabus taxonomy transcribed from the three official CAIE PDFs + classification (P4.2, D4.4),
student profile/onboarding data model that finally activates at-risk rule 2 (P4.3, D4.5,
migration 0009), placement backend reusing the *existing* quiz engine behind an XOR-checked
student-owned-quiz shape (P4.4, D4.6–D4.9, migration 0010), practice generator with tri-state
availability (P4.5, D4.10), flashcards + clock-injected SM-2 (P4.6, D4.11, migration 0011),
the adaptive study plan — pure scheduler, persisted, superseding weekly regeneration (P4.7,
D4.12/D4.13, migration 0012), and the ten screens S-01..S-05 / S-20..S-25 (P4.8/P4.9/P4.10,
D4.14–D4.22), closed by the acceptance + UI-gate pass (P4.11, D4.23–D4.25) that took `web/e2e/`
from 8 files/14 tests to 11/25.
**2350 tests (2344 passed / 6 skipped / 0 failed) / 90.18% cov** (from develop's 1939 /
89.42%); **all 13 gates green, 0 skipped**; 4 additive migrations, both directions clean;
122 axe route-states with zero violations at any severity, zero console errors, zero
horizontal-scroll violations, Lighthouse a11y floor 96; cross-phase compare 81 added /
**0 removed** / 78 changed. Merged to develop (321fdfc), pushed. PR #3 updated (title
"Phases 0–4"), NOT merged. Report: `reports/phase-4/REPORT.md`. Gemini cumulative
**$0.18429 / $8.00** (Phase 4 itself $0.0257 — everything built with Gemini mocked).

### Honest limitations carried forward from Phase 4 (must appear in DELIVERY.md, not silently resolved)
Full text in `reports/phase-4/REPORT.md` §7. The ones that change what a later phase may assume:
- **The Lighthouse performance floor MISSION §11 claims is gated is NOT enforced (D4.25).**
  `scripts/check_ui_gates.py` has no performance check at all; a student route sits at **79**
  and `ui-thresholds` passes. Do not cite MISSION §11's "performance ≥ 80" as a met gate.
  The specific failing route is not stable between runs; the gap is.
- **0580 and 0606 have zero ingested questions**, so placement and practice honestly refuse for
  two of three subjects. The ceiling is **mark-scheme parse coverage (32/72 for 0625)**, not
  stem extraction — that is the highest-leverage thing to improve, and it is not a P5 blocker.
- **A practice set is marked but its result cannot be read** — marking runs, marks are in the DB,
  no route exposes them for `kind=practice`. Only the *read* is missing.
- **`web/e2e/` + `playwright.config.ts` are still in no tsconfig `include` (D3.20)** — now
  covering 25 test blocks, none of them ever typechecked.
- **XP is entirely P5's and the seam is `completed_at`** (D4.17/D4.19). No points or streak
  column exists; S-23 and S-25 deliberately ship with no XP number. Do not assume P4 left a helper.
- **Phase 2's synthetic accuracy gate is unchanged** (83.8% vs ≥95%) and **D3.21's paper 22 is
  still confidently wrong** (40/40 marks at confidence 1.0, zero flags, 3 marks of pure
  vision/transcription error).
- **The visual compare can never be pixel-clean:** the seed's `run_tag` is random per run, so
  every screen rendering a class name changes on every re-baseline. `0 removed` is the number
  that carries the gate; a nonzero `changed` count is not by itself a regression signal.

### Task checklist
- [x] done — P4.1 / P4.2 / P4.3 / P4.4 (chunks A, B-1..B-4) / P4.5 / P4.6 (A,B,C) / P4.7 (A,B,C) /
      P4.8 (0,A,B,C) / P4.9 (0,A,B,C) / P4.10 (A,B,C,D) / P4.11 (A,B,C,D,E). Per-task rationale is
      pruned per MISSION §8b now that the report is committed and merged — see
      `reports/phase-4/REPORT.md`, `BUILD/DECISIONS.md` (D4.1–D4.25), or this file's git history.
- [x] done — **P4.12** Phase-4 report, merge to develop, push, update PR #3, ntfy.

## Phase 5 — Engagement layer — NOT STARTED
See MISSION §4 (Phase 5) + UI spec. Read Phase 4's limitations above before planning:
XP has no schema at all (only the `completed_at` seam), students still cannot see
announcements, and `notification_preferences` is written and read by nothing — P5 owns all
three and must not assume Phase 3 or 4 left it a helper.

### Environment facts worth not re-deriving (cost real work to find)
- Run gates as `./scripts/check.sh` in the **foreground** — it exports `$HOME/.local/bin`
  onto PATH itself, so all 13 gates run. A backgrounded run that a session dies on has
  happened repeatedly; the audit leg alone takes ~11 minutes.
- `pytest -q` emits **no `N passed` line** (a reporter plugin eats it). Count the progress
  characters in the `^[.sFEx]+ +\[ NN%\]` lines, or read the `Total coverage:` line.
- **Never run `pytest` concurrently with `./scripts/check.sh`.** Both drive `pytest-cov` and
  they contend on the same `.coverage` data file, so the *coverage figure* comes back badly
  wrong while the run still exits 0 — a concurrent run reported **89.67% with
  `practice_repo.py` at 68%**, where a clean serial run of the identical tree reported
  **90.37% and 99%**. The test counts stayed correct (2331/6/0 both times), which is what
  makes it convincing: it reads as a real coverage regression to be chased. Re-measure
  serially before believing any coverage drop.
- **`pre-commit` is not on PATH and two of its hooks cannot run.** The binary is
  `.venv/bin/pre-commit` (no bare `pre-commit`, and `$HOME/.local/bin` does not have it).
  Its `mypy` and `import-linter` hooks then fail with *"Executable not found"* — a defect in
  the hook environment, **not a code failure**: `./scripts/check.sh` runs both tools directly
  and they pass on the same tree. Verify there before believing a pre-commit red on those two.
- **`cd` in one Bash call persists into the next.** A `cd web` for an npx run leaves the
  following command running from `web/`, where `.venv/` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` do not
  exist — which reads as "the venv is gone". Prefix with an absolute `cd /home/sico/Lemely`.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` lives in `/home/sico/Lemely/.env` and is **not** exported into a
  non-interactive shell — `set -a && . ./.env && set +a`.
- The UI gates write to gitignored `reports/.scratch` (D3.2). Re-baseline explicitly with
  `LEMELY_REPORT_DIR`; never commit into a previous phase's report dir.
- The E2E backend is `scripts/e2e_server.py` on port 8000 — there is no module-level `app`
  attribute on `lemely.web.app`.
- `scripts/seed_e2e.py` is the ONE seeding path for both harnesses, all 5 roles.
- **The past-paper corpus is outside this repo**: `/home/sico/PaperScraper/papers/CAIE/igcse/
  <subject>-<code>/<year>/<session>/` (648 PDFs, 0580/0606/0625). `Sources/` holds only mark
  schemes and the 4 solved scripts — no question papers. Read-only from here.
- Re-parse mark schemes with `lemely parse-mark-schemes <corpus-dir> --output-root
  outputs/schemes --force --on-error continue` (~54s for 0625; 32/72 parse).
- **The ntfy server has attachments DISABLED — do not keep retrying them.** MISSION §7 says to
  PUT a file with a `Filename:` header; that endpoint returns **HTTP 400 `{"code":40014,
  "error":"invalid request: attachments not allowed"}`** on this instance (server-side config,
  not a request the orchestrator can fix). The JSON publish endpoint itself works fine (200).
  So: put the substance **in the message body** and use `click`/`actions` to link the artifact
  on GitHub instead of attaching it.
- **`pytest --collect-only` still runs the coverage plugin** and will clobber `.coverage` —
  pass `--no-cov`. Its `-q` output is one `path: N` line per file, so the total is
  `... | grep -E "^tests/.*: [0-9]+$" | awk -F': ' '{s+=$2} END {print s}'` (2350 at Phase 4).
- **The visual compare can never be pixel-clean**: `scripts/seed_e2e.py`'s `run_tag` is random
  per run, so every screen rendering a class name changes on every re-baseline. Read **`removed`**
  (must be 0), not `changed`, as the regression signal.

## Session journal
See `BUILD/JOURNAL.md` for the dated 3-6 line entries; decisions and rationale live in
`BUILD/DECISIONS.md` (D0.x/D1.x/D2.x). Superseded per-task narrative for Phases 0-2 has been
pruned from this file per MISSION §8b now that their reports are committed — see the git
history of this file, or the phase REPORT.md files, if the detail is ever needed again.
