## Rules for maintaining this file
- Update BEFORE starting and AFTER finishing every task. Assume sudden death.
- Keep exactly one task `doing` at a time.
- When all Phase-6 acceptance criteria pass and DELIVERY.md is committed,
  set `status: COMPLETE` — the supervisor stops on this value.
- Prune a phase's detail to a single summary line once its `reports/phase-N/REPORT.md`
  is committed and merged to develop (MISSION §8b) — full rationale lives in
  `BUILD/DECISIONS.md` and the phase report, not here.

## Phase 0 — Foundation repair — DONE (2026-07-30)
All 8 tasks complete: CI green (ruff/web), `lemely/io/det/` wired + monolith deleted (D0.5),
persistent Gemini cost ledger ($8 cap, D0.6), HistoryStore corruption surfaced, single lockfile,
`lemely doctor` real reachability. 395 passed / 84.56% cov. Merged to develop.
Report: `reports/phase-0/REPORT.md`. PR #3 (rolling develop→main, NOT merged).

## Phase 1 — Database + Auth + Tenancy — DONE (2026-08-01)
Local Supabase stack, 22-table schema (additive-only, D1.2/D1.3), GoTrue auth + backend-issued
HS256 JWTs (D1.4/D1.5), RBAC on every route + both IDORs killed (D1.6), HistoryStore→Postgres
for the web surface (D1.8/D1.9 — CLI/Gradio kept on JSON store), seat model (D1.10), 3-device
session registry (D1.11). Adversarial review: no Critical/High bypass (D1.12). 548 passed /
85.44% cov. Merged to develop. Report: `reports/phase-1/REPORT.md`.

### Carried backlog from Phase 1 (non-blocking, do opportunistically)
- [ ] todo — (D1.9) Migrate CLI + Gradio history to the DB (or retire Gradio), then delete
      `lemely/io/history_store.py` + `tests/test_history_store.py`. Parity already proven.
- [x] done — (D1.6) Teacher per-tenant ownership (own-classes-only). Closed across P3.1
      (`ClassService` replaced the implicit "all students are one cohort" endpoints) and
      P3.3 (`/api/teacher/overview` stopped enumerating every student in the store; pinned
      by a two-teacher disjoint-class regression test). Row-level ownership is now real.

## Phase 2 — The core loop, real and end-to-end — DONE (2026-08-05)
Real SSE correction pipeline (P2.1), grade-boundary ingestion from cambridgeinternational.org
(P2.2, D2.1), accuracy harness + 10 golden fixtures across 0580/0606/0625 (P2.3), plagiarism/
AI-detection advisory flags (P2.4), Supabase Storage upload path (P2.5, D2.6), frontend
resurrected from dead code + auth/session foundation (P2.6), student + teacher surfaces wired
to real data (P2.7/P2.8), PWA foundation + camera capture (P2.9), Playwright E2E acceptance
verified against the live Supabase stack with an independent Postgres persistence check
(P2.10). 609 passed / 3 skipped (live-only) / 86.38% cov. Merged to develop (6254879), pushed.
PR #3 updated (title "Phases 0–2", body extended), NOT merged. ntfy sent.
Report: `reports/phase-2/REPORT.md`. Gemini cumulative spend $0.058/$8.00.

### Honest limitations carried forward from Phase 2 (must appear in DELIVERY.md, not silently resolved)
- **Accuracy gate NOT met (D2.5):** mark-level agreement 83.8% vs ≥95% target; flag_recall
  27.3% vs the 100%-disagreements-flagged target. Threshold tuning (D2.2/D2.3) and
  deterministic calculated-answer verification (D2.4) are both exhausted; the remaining gap
  is free-form algebraic method-verification — materially harder, out of scope so far.
- **PWA Lighthouse + camera-capture** not live-tested (no Chromium/camera in this sandbox,
  P2.9) — verified by inspection/manual trace only; see `reports/phase-2/pwa-limitations.md`.
  Needs a real-device/browser pass before claiming a hard pass.

## Phase 2.5 — Design system + frontend quality foundation — DONE (2026-08-05)
Token layer sourced from DESIGN.md (P2.5.1), C-1..C-13 component library + catalogue
(P2.5.2), Phase-2 screen retrofit onto tokens/components (P2.5.3), Impeccable audit+polish
(P2.5.4, D2.11), Playwright screenshot corpus (P2.5.5, D2.12), Puppeteer axe/Lighthouse
audit runner (P2.5.6), `scripts/check.sh` created from scratch — a Phase-0 mandate that had
never actually existed — plus a real CI-breaking `ruff`/`.claude` exclusion bug fixed along
the way (P2.5.7, D2.13), full QUALITY-BAR.md pass to zero serious/critical axe violations +
Lighthouse a11y 100 across all 4 in-scope routes (P2.5.8, D2.14). 609 passed / 85.54% cov
(zero backend files touched this phase; coverage delta from Phase 2 is environmental
live-test-skip variance, not a regression — see report §4). Merged to develop (fcc3e07),
pushed. PR #3 updated (title "Phases 0–2.5"), NOT merged. ntfy sent.
Report: `reports/phase-2.5/REPORT.md`. Gemini cumulative spend $0.058/$8.00 (unchanged —
pure frontend/tooling phase, zero LLM calls).
Decisions: D2.10–D2.14. Deferred/flagged component-library gaps for a future pass: see
report §8 (sub-44px touch target, non-heading empty/error tags, no mobile BottomNav, raw
`max-[1180px]:` literals outside the retrofitted screens, momentum-chart/TrendSparkline
duplication blocked on a DTO change).

## Phase 3 — Teacher + Parent surfaces — DONE (2026-08-07)
Real class model + teacher tenancy closing the last cross-tenant leak (P3.1, D3.1), the
at-risk flagging engine (P3.2, D3.3), teacher analytics T-04/T-05/T-06 (P3.3, D3.4), review
queue override-and-annotate + evidence-scoped acknowledgement (P3.4/P3.4b, D3.5), the quiz
builder end to end — bank, builder, assignment, student take/submit, auto-marking through the
*existing* engine, class results (P3.5, D3.6–D3.10, design fixed in `docs/quiz-model.md`),
parent portal backend + notification preferences (P3.6, D3.11), sixteen frontend screens
across three portals all on real data (P3.7 T-01..T-06, P3.8 T-07..T-10 + T-12 + the
announcements backend, P3.9 G-05 + P-01..P-04), and the acceptance/UI-gate pass that turned
`audit.mjs` from a 4-route single-journey script into a 24-route/34-state registry
(P3.10, D3.17/D3.18/D3.20). Plus the INBOX real-past-paper accuracy directive (D3.21) and the
MCQ integrity guard (D3.19). Blockers B1/B2/B3 all raised and resolved.
**1939 tests (1933 passed / 6 skipped / 0 failed) / 89.42% cov** (from develop's 609 /
85.54%); **all 13 gates green, 0 skipped**; 5 additive migrations, `alembic check` clean both
directions; 24 routes / 34 states audited with zero axe violations at any severity, zero
console errors, zero horizontal-scroll violations, Lighthouse a11y floor 96. Merged to develop
(49d9750), pushed. PR #3 updated (title "Phases 0–3"; its body had never actually carried a
Phase-2.5 section despite that phase's STATE line claiming so — added in the same edit), NOT
merged. Report: `reports/phase-3/REPORT.md`. Gemini cumulative spend **$0.1586 / $8.00**.

### Honest limitations carried forward from Phase 3 (must appear in DELIVERY.md, not silently resolved)
Full text in `reports/phase-3/REPORT.md` §7. The ones that change what a later phase may
assume:
- **The question bank is empty and corpus growth cannot change that (D3.7).** A mark scheme
  holds marking points; the question *stem* lives in the question paper and no stem extractor
  exists. This is a **P4 prerequisite**, not an assumption — do not re-run the measurement.
- **At-risk rule 2 cannot fire until P4 supplies target grades (D3.3)** — the engine reports
  it as *not evaluable*, never as a pass, and it is absent from the T-06 reason filter.
- **Teacher-route Lighthouse performance floors at 67** (`teacher-quiz-detail`). MISSION §11's
  ≥80 floor covers the student routes (met, floor 82) and never covered these.
- **Lighthouse runs on `default` states only**; axe runs on all 34 (deliberate, D3.17).
- **`web/e2e/` + `playwright.config.ts` are in no tsconfig `include`** — the most expensive
  gate has never been typechecked (D3.20).
- **Students cannot see announcements**; `notification_preferences` is written and read by
  nothing. Both are **P5's**, and P5 must not assume Phase 3 left it a helper.
- **Paper 22 was confidently wrong (D3.21):** all 40 marks at confidence 1.0, zero review
  flags, 3 marks of pure vision/transcription error. Propagating extraction confidence into
  per-question confidence on the deterministic MCQ path changes the marking contract and was
  deliberately not patched at phase end.
- **Phase 2's synthetic-golden-set accuracy gate is unchanged** (83.8% vs ≥95%). The
  real-paper measurement is on top of it, not a replacement.

### Task checklist
- [x] done — P3.1 / P3.1b / P3.2 / P3.3 / P3.4 / P3.4b / P3.5 (chunks C,A,G,B,D,E,F1,F2) /
      P3.6 (a,b) / P3.7 (a–d) / P3.8 (a–d) / P3.9 (a–d) / P3.10 (a–e) / P3.10-B3 /
      INBOX-2026-08-07-ACC. Per-task rationale is pruned per MISSION §8b now that the report
      is committed and merged — see `reports/phase-3/REPORT.md`, `BUILD/DECISIONS.md`
      (D3.1–D3.21), `BUILD/BLOCKERS.md` (B1–B3), or this file's git history.
- [x] done — **P3.11** Phase-3 report, merge to develop, push, update PR #3, ntfy.

## Phase 4 — Content generation + study plans — IN PROGRESS (started 2026-08-07)
Branch: `feature/phase-4-content-study-plans`. See MISSION §4 + UI spec §4.2 (S-01..S-05),
§4.5 (S-20..S-25). Read the Phase-3 limitations above before planning: the question-stem
extractor and the target-grade column are both P4 prerequisites that P3 established, not
open questions.

**What Phase 3 already left that P4 composes rather than rebuilds:** `QuestionBank` +
`QuestionBankService` (`lemely/db/question_bank_repo.py`, incl. `survey_past_paper_questions`),
the quiz take/submit/auto-mark path (`quiz_taking_repo`/`quiz_marking_repo`), `core/difficulty.py`,
`core/generation.py` (`GeneratedQuestion`), `io/question_generation.py`, `core/study_plan.py`
(a naive proportional scheduler) + `io/study_plan_ai.py` narration, and the `StudyPlan.tsx`
screen. The placement test and practice sets are quiz-shaped: reuse that engine, do not fork it.

### Task checklist
- [ ] doing — **P4.1** Question-stem extractor (D4.1). **Structurally done and verified; four
      content defects out for fix.** `lemely/io/det/question_papers.py` (deterministic, zero
      Gemini) + `lemely/io/question_papers.py` pairing/writer + `lemely question-bank
      ingest-question-papers`. Checkpointed at `4c58c15`.
      **Orchestrator-measured yield (0625): 72 papers → 2090 leaves → 298 banked** (206 MCQ,
      92 theory), 651 figure-excluded, re-ingest idempotent. Bank is no longer empty — D3.7 closed.
      Open defects sent back to the implementer: PUA symbol-font glyphs (16 prompts / 34
      mark-point sets / 17 option sets), `© UCLES` footer leakage (30 prompts), diagram-only MCQ
      options banked empty (3 rows), flattened superscripts (4 prompts), and a silent
      no-op on a nonexistent `--schemes-dir`. Re-measure with `/tmp/p41_quality.py`.
      **Corpus expanded** via paperscraper: 312 qp + 312 ms across 0580/0606/0625, 0 failures.
      **Ceiling worth knowing:** only 32/72 0625 mark schemes parse deterministically, and a
      stem needs its scheme to be bankable — mark-scheme parse coverage, not stem extraction,
      is what caps bank size.
- [ ] todo — **P4.2** Syllabus topic taxonomy + classification of bank questions (0580/0606/0625).
- [ ] todo — **P4.3** Student profile + onboarding data model (migration 0009): grade level,
      school, external lessons, weekly study hours, per-subject enrolment with **target grade**,
      papers, confidence sliders. Activating target grades also closes at-risk rule 2 (D3.3) —
      wire it into the at-risk engine and the T-06 reason filter in the same task.
- [ ] todo — **P4.4** Placement test backend: ~15-min per-subject assembly from the bank across
      topics, serve/resume/submit, mark through the existing engine, initialise weakness profile.
- [ ] todo — **P4.5** Practice generator backend: topic/difficulty/count/source filtering,
      persisted practice sets, "not enough questions" honesty path, export/print payload.
- [ ] todo — **P4.6** Flashcards backend: decks by subject/topic, AI deck generation from a
      weakness, SM-2-style spaced repetition, review sessions.
- [ ] todo — **P4.7** Adaptive study plan: rebuild the scheduler on placement + questionnaire +
      rolling performance; weekly regeneration; concrete sessions (topic, activity type,
      duration); completion + XP hook (XP itself is P5 — leave a seam, do not build it).
- [ ] todo — **P4.8** Frontend S-01..S-05 (onboarding steps + placement in-progress/results).
- [ ] todo — **P4.9** Frontend S-20/S-21 (practice) + S-22/S-23 (flashcards).
- [ ] todo — **P4.10** Frontend S-24/S-25 (study-plan week view + session detail), replacing the
      current placeholder `StudyPlan.tsx`.
- [ ] todo — **P4.11** Acceptance + standing UI gate: E2E (onboard → placement → plan; practice
      targets seeded weaknesses), axe/Lighthouse, screenshot corpus for every new screen × state ×
      breakpoint, **maths notation + diagram rendering verified visually in screenshots, not
      assumed** (MISSION §4 names this explicitly).
- [ ] todo — **P4.12** Phase-4 report, merge to develop, push, update PR #3, ntfy.

### Environment facts worth not re-deriving (cost real work to find)
- Run gates as `./scripts/check.sh` in the **foreground** — it exports `$HOME/.local/bin`
  onto PATH itself, so all 13 gates run. A backgrounded run that a session dies on has
  happened repeatedly; the audit leg alone takes ~11 minutes.
- `pytest -q` emits **no `N passed` line** (a reporter plugin eats it). Count the progress
  characters in the `^[.sFEx]+ +\[ NN%\]` lines, or read the `Total coverage:` line.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` lives in `/home/sico/Lemely/.env` and is **not** exported into a
  non-interactive shell — `set -a && . ./.env && set +a`.
- The UI gates write to gitignored `reports/.scratch` (D3.2). Re-baseline explicitly with
  `LEMELY_REPORT_DIR`; never commit into a previous phase's report dir.
- The E2E backend is `scripts/e2e_server.py` on port 8000 — there is no module-level `app`
  attribute on `lemely.web.app`.
- `scripts/seed_e2e.py` is the ONE seeding path for both harnesses, all 5 roles.

## Session journal
See `BUILD/JOURNAL.md` for the dated 3-6 line entries; decisions and rationale live in
`BUILD/DECISIONS.md` (D0.x/D1.x/D2.x). Superseded per-task narrative for Phases 0-2 has been
pruned from this file per MISSION §8b now that their reports are committed — see the git
history of this file, or the phase REPORT.md files, if the detail is ever needed again.
