## REDESIGN (REDESIGN-MISSION.md) — ACTIVE

### Live status

```
MISSION:            BUILD/REDESIGN-MISSION.md
CURRENT PHASE:      4 — Surface-by-surface redesign (Phases 0-3 DONE)
CURRENT SURFACE:    Student dashboard DONE (1 of 10). Next: **past-paper
                    correction flow** -> study surfaces -> gamification ->
                    Teacher dashboard + quiz builder -> Parent -> Admin ->
                    Auth -> Marketing -> 404/misc.
CURRENT BRANCH:     redesign/student-dashboard  (off redesign/phase-0; per §11)
NEXT ACTION:        Phase 4, surface 2: **past-paper correction flow**
                    (`screens/CorrectPaper.tsx`, `screens/PaperResult.tsx`).
                    Read DESIGN.md, D4.1 (what surface 1 learned), D3.22, and
                    the audit rows M4/M5 — both are about this flow and both
                    are real: the marking wait loses all progress on refresh,
                    and a marking failure offers no retry except re-uploading
                    from scratch. §5's Phase 6.2 owns the full wait-experience
                    design; do not silently pull it forward, but do not ship a
                    redesigned failure state without a retry either.

                    New since Phase 3, inherited by every later surface:
                    - `scripts/capture_surface.mjs` is the batched visual
                      round while B4 blocks the real corpus. It STUBS the API:
                      its images are evidence about layout, never behaviour.
                      It hashes every capture and fails when two states that
                      must differ are identical — do not remove that check,
                      it caught a round where all ten images were the same
                      error screen.
                    - `toneFill()` (badge.tsx) and `subjectToneForCode()`
                      (subject-tag.tsx) are the sanctioned ways to reach a
                      pastel outside `<Badge>`/`<SubjectTag>`.
                    - `resolveCrumbTrail` (student/data.ts) feeds the student
                      header's real `<Breadcrumbs>`. Derived from
                      `resolveCrumb` so the two cannot disagree.

                    Standing rules Phase 4 inherits, all of them enforced:
                    - `npm run check:copy` must not grow. 91 prose em-dashes
                      remain on un-migrated screens; §9.8 binds the gate to
                      new/edited copy, so each surface clears its own as it
                      lands. It is not a silent exemption.
                    - Add each migrated file to RTL_CLEAN_FILES in
                      `tests/unit/rtlSafety.test.ts`. The list only grows.
                    - Stamp every emitted surface with the hallmark pre-emit
                      critique (§9.1). Phase 2's 19 kit components are
                      UNSTAMPED — stamp each as you touch it, do not back-fill
                      scores nobody re-derived.
                    - Replace text loaders with `loading-shapes.tsx` as each
                      surface's geometry settles. ~23 remain, deliberately:
                      a skeleton must match the layout that replaces it, and
                      Phase 4 is what changes those layouts.
                    - Build-era screens still consume the compat token aliases
                      in index.css. Phase 4 migrates them surface by surface.

                    **Re-ask D1.6 before admin views.** Still open, still
                    deliberately undefaulted. Block there rather than guess.

                    **B4 blocks the e2e gate** (BUILD/BLOCKERS.md). One
                    command from the human clears it; do not kill the
                    port-8000 process unattended, it belongs to another user.

### Phase ledger

| Phase | Status | Completed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0. Setup & Verification | DONE | 2026-08-13 | All 9 skills loadable; nothing needed installing. Node 26.6.0, Python 3.13.5, Playwright 1.62.1 (web/), Gemini key in gitignored `.env`, spend $0.204/$8 (image budget for this mission ≤$3). impeccable hook already `enabled`; `context.mjs` clean apart from one stale-context finding, fixed. PRODUCT.md already existed from the build era and was corrected rather than regenerated (see notes). ntfy verified in **both** directions. |
| 1. Audit | DONE | 2026-08-13 | Three legs, all read-only, `web/` verified untouched after each. Merged into `BUILD/DESIGN-AUDIT.md`; leg reports in `BUILD/audit/`. 6 critical, 14 major, 3 minor. Root cause is one thing: every token is still the build-era Material-3 palette, so zero pages are Study Notebook yet. Worse than that and independently confirmed by me: 3 fabrications on the landing page, no error boundary anywhere, no skeleton component anywhere. **Coverage is partial and stated so — nothing was verified against a rendered viewport, and 34 of 48 routes were reached by grep only.** |
| 2. Brand & Design System | DONE | 2026-08-13 | All 6 steps done. Brand strategy at `BUILD/BRAND.md`; logo hand-authored as SVG after the Gemini refine pass failed on all five named defects (D2 defaulted to ship it). DESIGN.md rewritten from scratch as the Study Notebook; index.css is its implementation with a documented temporary compatibility layer so un-migrated screens pick up the new palette instead of staying Material-3. `tests/test_design_tokens.py` pins every contrast claim and caught two real AA failures plus one greyscale failure in my own draft. Landing-page fabrications C1/C2 fixed, plus a third the audit missed (a stated 0.70 review threshold that is really 0.90). Component kit: 19 components, all 8 states, preview page at `web/dev-previews/` with its own Vite entry so the product can never ship it. Closed the audit's "no skeleton component" and "no error boundary" gaps. Three defects found by verifying rather than trusting the agent reports: RadioGroup did not actually have 8 states; the preview page was silently missing every utility used only inside a component (Tailwind source detection is rooted at the entry CSS, fixed with `@source`, CSS went 28KB→69KB); and a hover-pinning device I built emitted zero CSS and was removed rather than left to quietly pass review. |
| 3. IA & UX Flows | DONE | 2026-08-13 | All four parts done, D1.1-5 implemented. The headline is what the audit could not see from source: **neither the student nor teacher portal had ANY navigation below 820px/768px** — sidebars simply `hidden`, nothing replacing them, on a product whose own brief says students live on phones. Fixed with a shared `NavDrawer` rendering the same list as the desktop aside. Also removed two cross-portal links `RequireAuth` bounces for every role that exists (dead for everyone), and 4 dead keys in the student `crumbs` map. First-run views for student + teacher (`GettingStarted`); the parent's was already right and was deliberately left alone. Four honesty defects fixed in passing: a fabricated school name and hardcoded date on the teacher dashboard, hardcoded greetings on both, and two 'Coming soon' buttons for features that shipped. Three rules got gates rather than sweeps (`check:copy`, `rtlSafety`, `navigation`), and each found a real defect while being written. 646 unit tests (+59), typecheck/lint/both builds/pre-commit clean, no horizontal scroll at 320/375/1440. **e2e blocked by B4** — environmental, verified pre-existing at `0451e5e`, not a Phase 3 regression. See D3.22. |
| 4. Surface redesign | IN PROGRESS | — | 1 of 10 surfaces done (student dashboard). Headline finding is one nothing in this build could have caught: **`--font-serif` was never a token, so ~20 call sites across five screens were rendering Georgia, not Newsreader** — the display face DESIGN.md mandates was on screen nowhere it was reached by that name. Verified in the shipped bundle before and after, not reasoned about. A missing definition fails silently where a wrong one would not: the token gate greps for raw values *bypassing* the block, and `font-serif` is a well-formed utility resolving to somebody else's default. Also: both dashboard charts drew a blank box where §11 mandates an empty state (the momentum panel's empty case is *every* student who just marked their first paper), the trend column told a one-paper student they were improving by "+0" in teal, and "Forecast" rendered a space-joined concatenation of per-subject grades under a label promising one value. See D4.1. |

### Gate status (current surface only)

```
SURFACE:            Student dashboard (Overview + student portal shell)
BUILD COMPLETE:     yes
INSPECTION ROUND:   1 (batched, desktop 1440 + 375 together, 5 states each)
FINDINGS TO FIX:    4, all fixed in one batch —
                    (a) grade badges collapsed to "BPredicted" on desktop
                        (`md:block` overrode the component's inline-flex);
                    (b) ~600px dead space per subject row (flex share was on
                        the text column, which is nearly empty);
                    (c) momentum panel a third empty (88px chart pinned to the
                        top of a card stretched to its taller sibling);
                    (d) capture fixture incoherent (1 momentum point paired
                        with "4 papers corrected", a state the API cannot
                        produce).
CONFIRM ROUND:      1, all four confirmed fixed. Stopped there (§3.2 item 16).
HALLMARK STAMP:     present on Overview.tsx, student/index.tsx, card.tsx,
                    primitives.tsx. 15 of Phase 2's 19 kit components remain
                    unstamped, per D3.22 — stamped as each is touched.
HOOK FINDINGS:      0 (impeccable design hook, every touched file)
TESTS:              662 unit (+16), all green
```

### Open DECISIONs

| ID | Question | Options | Default | Sent | Timeout | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1.6 | Build real school-admin + platform-admin screens? None exist; both roles are routed into `/teacher` today. ~7 screens, new route subtree, un-bundles the `TEACHER_ROLES` guard `rbac.spec.ts` asserts against. | A build now / B defer, stay on `/teacher` / C scaffold routes+shells only | **none — deliberately not defaulted** | 2026-08-13T15:05Z | none | OPEN |

D1.6 carries no default on purpose: §10 says a question with no sane default must not be a
timeout question. It does not block Phase 2 or 3. Re-ask before Phase 4 reaches admin views;
if still unanswered then, that is the point to block rather than guess.

### Resolved

| ID | Outcome | When |
|---|---|---|
| D1.1–5 | **DEFAULTED — proceed as proposed.** 60-minute timeout elapsed with no reply. The five cost-free IA corrections are approved by default and are implemented in Phase 3.1. | 2026-08-13T18:10+03:00 |
| D2 | **DEFAULTED — option A, ship the hand-authored SVG mark.** 30-minute timeout elapsed with no reply. Assets are at `web/public/brand/` (mark, mono, favicon cuts). Not yet wired into `index.html`; that is Phase 6.5's strategic-omissions closeout. | 2026-08-13T18:10+03:00 |

### Steering log pointer

Full log: `BUILD/STEERING.md` (created in Phase 0).
Last processed inbound message: none from the human. The only entry on the inbound topic is
my own Phase-0 selftest (`IOd08AgAn9Hf`, ts 1786629363), and `LAST STEERING TS` is set past
it so it can never be replayed as a directive.

### Deferred issues (found during redesign, not blocking)

- **Phase 0 note — PRODUCT.md was corrected, not regenerated.** `/impeccable init` would have
  overwritten a build-era file that already carries five roles, the real product loop, the
  binding anti-references, and the evidence-on-hand list. Four edits were made instead:
  the deprecated `## Register` section became `## Modes` (impeccable v4 dropped register for
  the four visitor modes; nothing reads `## Register` any more), §4's anti-references and the
  protected notebook quality were added, and the line "layouts need not solve RTL yet" was
  replaced — it directly contradicted Phase 3.4's RTL-safety rule.
- **`DESIGN.md` at the repo root is build-era and predates the Study Notebook direction.**
  Phase 2 replaces it. Until then no surface work should read it as the token source.

---

## Update rules (for the agent)

1. Update `Live status` block on every work-unit boundary; `LAST UPDATED` always current.
2. Phase/surface ledgers: flip status only, append notes; never delete rows.
3. Gate status block is scratch space for the current surface; reset it when a surface
   merges (copy its outcome into the surface ledger first).
4. DECISIONs: add on send, move to Resolved with the answer on resolution or timeout
   (mark timeouts as "DEFAULTED").
5. `LAST STEERING TS` advances only after the message is logged AND acted on or queued.
6. Commit STATE.md with the work it describes, same commit.

### Phase 4 deliverables (for later surfaces to read)

| Artefact | Path | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Visual round | `web/scripts/capture_surface.mjs` | Batched capture while B4 blocks the real corpus. **Stubs the API** — layout evidence, never behaviour. Fails when two states that must differ are identical. |
| Captures | `reports/redesign/p4-student-dashboard/` | 5 states x 1440/375. Fixture numbers, not product data. |
| Tone escape hatch | `toneFill` in `components/ui/badge.tsx` | Pastel fill+text pairing without `Badge`'s pill shape. |
| Subject colour by code | `subjectToneForCode` in `components/ui/subject-tag.tsx` | §3.8, for surfaces whose data carries a syllabus code rather than a name. |
| Student crumb trail | `resolveCrumbTrail` in `portals/student/data.ts` | Derived from `resolveCrumb`; feeds the header's real `<Breadcrumbs>`. |
| Ledger grid | `grid-subject-ledger` in `index.css` | Flex share on the meter, not the text column. |

### Phase 3 deliverables (for later phases to read)

| Artefact | Path | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile nav | `web/src/components/ui/nav-drawer.tsx` | The only navigation that exists below 820/768px. Same list as the desktop aside, from the same code. |
| Breadcrumbs | `web/src/components/ui/breadcrumbs.tsx` | D1.5's back affordance. Collapses to one back link below `sm`. |
| Skip link | `web/src/components/ui/skip-link.tsx` | Wired in all three portals. `MAIN_CONTENT_ID` is the `<main>` target. |
| First-run panel | `web/src/components/ui/getting-started.tsx` | `done` only with evidence — no endpoint reports onboarding progress. |
| Loading shapes | `web/src/components/ui/loading-shapes.tsx` | Composed skeletons. Use these as each surface's geometry settles. |
| 404 + error screen | `web/src/portals/misc/NotFound.tsx` | Router `errorElement` on every top-level route, plus `path: "*"`. Static import on purpose. |
| Copy gate | `web/scripts/check_copy.mjs` | `npm run check:copy`. Classifier unit-tested; do not let the count grow. |
| RTL gate | `web/tests/unit/rtlSafety.test.ts` | Append each migrated file to `RTL_CLEAN_FILES`. |
| Nav gate | `web/tests/unit/navigation.test.ts` | Cross-checks every nav destination and crumb against mounted routes. |
| Greeting | `greetingFor` in `web/src/lib/utils.ts` | Both dashboards previously hardcoded the time of day. |

### Phase 2 deliverables (for later phases to read)

| Artefact | Path | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Design system | `DESIGN.md` | The source of truth. Read before emitting any UI. |
| Brand strategy | `BUILD/BRAND.md` | Meaning, not values. Wins over DESIGN.md on meaning only. |
| Tokens | `web/src/index.css` | Implementation of DESIGN.md, plus a documented temporary compat layer. |
| Contrast guarantees | `tests/test_design_tokens.py` | 28 tests. Pins every ratio DESIGN.md claims. |
| Logo | `web/public/brand/` | mark / mark-mono / mark-favicon. NOT yet wired into `index.html` — that is Phase 6.5. |
| Logo candidates | `BUILD/brand/` | 4 Gemini renders + 1 refine + the D2 contact sheet. |
| Component kit | `web/src/components/ui/` | 19 components, 8 states each. |
| Kit preview | `web/dev-previews/` | `npm run preview:kit`. Separate Vite entry; never shipped. |
| Generation script | `scripts/gen_brand_images.py` | Books spend into the real cost ledger and refuses to breach the ceiling. |

**Budget correction, carried forward:** the mission assumed an $8 Gemini ceiling.
The real one is **$4.99** (`lemely.toml:20`). Image spend this phase was $0.195 of
the $3 allowance; cumulative is **$0.399 / $4.99**.
